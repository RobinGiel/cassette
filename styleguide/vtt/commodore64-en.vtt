now for the Commodore 64 videotape

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.840
training with Commodores foremost

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.890
authority Jim Butterfield hello I'm Jim

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.390
Butterfield and I'd like to tell you

5
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.380
about the Commodore 64

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.700
14 exciting sessions on today's hottest

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.980
selling home computer vital up-to-date

8
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.750
information to inform the novice and

9
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.560
intrigued the experience

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:39.280
[Music]

11
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.410
hello my name is Jim Butterfield and I'd

12
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.739
like to tell you about the Commodore 64

13
00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.090
it's a pretty good computer it has a lot

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.660
of features very good color sound

15
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.660
picture graphics an excellent keyboard a

16
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.210
huge amount of memory and the price is

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.980
certainly right let's take a look inside

18
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:06.890
the box and see what we have in here the

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.270
first thing you'll see when you open the

20
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.869
box is a Commodore 64 itself that's the

21
00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.399
whole computer it looks just like a

22
00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.229
typewriter keyboard but it's everything

23
00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.330
all we need to do is to connect it up

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.920
let's see what else we have on the box

25
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.450
waiting for us in here we have the

26
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.149
Commodore 64 users guide that's a very

27
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.340
useful book you'll need that don't throw

28
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.200
it away all sorts of cables and

29
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.280
connectors in here

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.340
the first and most important is we need

31
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.810
to be able to connect power into the

32
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.750
computer will do it through this

33
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.159
transformer regulator device but there's

34
00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.590
more this cable just to connect from the

35
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.680
computer almost to your TV set in order

36
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.790
to complete the connection to your

37
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.170
television set you'll need one more

38
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.110
thing an antenna switch switch box and

39
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.060
this comes inside the box too it has a

40
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.860
little switch on it will show you how to

41
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:09.560
use it later let's put the Box away and

42
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.519
let's just take a look at the

43
00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.780
connections that you have on the

44
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.110
Commodore 64 before we hook it up first

45
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.140
of all over here we have two what are

46
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.570
called control ports they use for things

47
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.079
like joysticks paddles and even

48
00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.269
specialized things like light pens and

49
00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.310
so on next to this we have our on/off

50
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.079
switch but that's no good to us until we

51
00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.209
hook up the power and the connector next

52
00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.560
to it that's where the power goes

53
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.600
let's go we have lots more connections

54
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.010
so let's go around the corner here and

55
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.680
here we have what is called a cartridge

56
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.380
connector that's where most of our big

57
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.190
things plug in such as extra memory

58
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.100
large cartridge programs next to it we

59
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.810
have a little channel selector you can

60
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.040
select either channel through your

61
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.930
channel for depending on which channel

62
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.730
is available in your television viewing

63
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.910
area and here is a connector that will

64
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.880
hook up to our TV set continuing along

65
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.860
there sometimes you may have something a

66
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.570
little classier than the TV set called a

67
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.000
monitor if you do you don't want this

68
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.950
connection that's called an RF signal

69
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.959
you'll want the one next to it that's

70
00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.970
the signal for a monitor called a video

71
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.489
signal we'll talk about that again in a

72
00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.830
moment next to it this is called a

73
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.800
serial bus connector this one will hook

74
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.060
up to devices like floppy discs like

75
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.610
your printer for example notice that one

76
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.709
connector hooks up to everything one

77
00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.330
connector serves on but there's still

78
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.760
more the next one is where we connect

79
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.400
our cassette tapes our Commodore data

80
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.459
set as it's called now this is a device

81
00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.350
you can use to soar programs or data

82
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.150
we'll look at that in a moment too but

83
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.100
that's where it plugs in and finally you

84
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.500
have what's called a user port that can

85
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.450
be used for anything you like but the

86
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.209
most common use is for a modem to plug

87
00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.850
in something for communications to other

88
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.920
computers to other cities

89
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.120
ok we finished our tour let's plug this

90
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.549
machine in we'll start with our power

91
00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.590
and first of all let's get all of these

92
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.250
cables loose

93
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.639
and we'll take the rubber band off here

94
00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.110
okay here we go this is quite heavy so

95
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.669
put enough flora somewhere convenient

96
00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.610
this part plugs into the power connector

97
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.680
we mentioned previously let's take a

98
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.340
look at that and here we go

99
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.419
okay now this part will plug into our

100
00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.650
power plug in the floor we'll hook that

101
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.440
up a little later the only thing left

102
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.389
now is to hook up our TV set here we

103
00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.990
have quite a long cable so if you have a

104
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.000
big TV set you can stand well back from

105
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.650
it there's a long lot of distance here

106
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.650
once again the place we hook it up on

107
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.990
the back TV sets plug into this

108
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.790
connector here called the RF connector

109
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.890
and this is what goes to the TV set

110
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.390
itself but first the antenna switch box

111
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.580
will plug it in there and if we want to

112
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.190
watch TV we can hook our antenna there

113
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.979
if for watching TV we switch over to our

114
00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.500
antenna for using the computer we switch

115
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.000
over the computer either way the signal

116
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.010
comes in and hooks onto the back of our

117
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.169
television set here let's turn our

118
00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.380
computer around again and we'll hook

119
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.479
things into the back of our TV set on

120
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.160
the little screw terminals that you

121
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.460
always find there okay and there we go

122
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.630
by the way there are some sorts of

123
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.400
television sets that have an unusual

124
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.229
antenna connection instead of two screw

125
00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.260
connections you'll find a little what's

126
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.450
called a 75 ohm connection if you have

127
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.280
that you can buy a little adapter at

128
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.050
your television store to do the job on

129
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.180
there now that's all we need for our

130
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.150
minimum computer setup the things that

131
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.580
come in the box and your home television

132
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.710
set but if you want to you can spend

133
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.660
extra money and you can get a more

134
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.060
deluxe version of the 64 you can add

135
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.800
things to it I'd like to talk to some

136
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.810
about some of those let's move over to

137
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.729
the desk here and talk about what we

138
00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.310
have here first of all this is not a

139
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.820
television set this is called a monitor

140
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.690
about the only way you can tell the

141
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.789
difference is that this one doesn't

142
00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.590
really have a tuner you can't select

143
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.060
which channel you want to watch because

144
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.300
it isn't designed to watch television

145
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.310
instead it gets the signal directly from

146
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.020
on the different connector directly from

147
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.330
the commodore 64 and

148
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.099
plugs into the video connector on the

149
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.080
front to give you a much better quality

150
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.889
picture now this particular monitor is a

151
00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.620
Commodore 1701 and besides the regular

152
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.750
video connector there are some extra

153
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.219
connections on the back which gives you

154
00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.400
a very very good quality picture if you

155
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.099
have a Commodore 64 and this Commodore

156
00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.740
video monitor do try to get a special

157
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.389
cable it doesn't come in the box try to

158
00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:55.250
get a special cable to hook up to the

159
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.020
connections on the back of your TV set

160
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.969
you'll get a much much better picture

161
00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.039
just a marvelous picture it's well worth

162
00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:03.740
the extra travel to get the cable now

163
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.030
I'm gonna to cut sex for money because

164
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.319
you haven't got one of them sitting

165
00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.460
around your home all the time

166
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.229
but it does give you a better picture

167
00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.940
and there's another advantage and that

168
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.039
is you won't have to fight over who's

169
00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.199
gonna watch the soap operas and who's

170
00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.090
going to use the computer at any given

171
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.250
time you'll both have your own hookup

172
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.870
and there won't be any conflict there

173
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.460
let's talk about some of the other

174
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.469
things that we connect to a Commodore 64

175
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:27.710
computer this is called a data set it's

176
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.349
a type of cassette recorder and what it

177
00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.139
can contains when we open it up is a

178
00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:35.330
conventional cassette tape very much

179
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.370
like the tapes that you'd use for for

180
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.529
example recording music they're

181
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:41.180
identical tapes but the information on

182
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.120
them is not music it's programs or it's

183
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.629
computer data this is one of the ways of

184
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:49.580
storing programs and data a different

185
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.800
way is to use what's called a floppy

186
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.349
disk drive which is this device over

187
00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:57.169
here this one holds its information once

188
00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:59.419
again magnetically but on a device which

189
00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:02.060
is called a floppy disk you can hold a

190
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.680
great deal of information on a floppy

191
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.719
disk and you can recall it very very

192
00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:07.969
quickly if you want to but when you have

193
00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:10.610
a floppy disk system you have to pay the

194
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.409
therm amount of money and so if your

195
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.930
economy minded you'll probably go over

196
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.330
to the cassette if on the other hand you

197
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.830
want the deluxe version for storing

198
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.080
programs you'll probably pay extra and

199
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.479
go for the disc it's your choice and in

200
00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:26.479
fact you can have both finally the only

201
00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:28.099
other accessory that we haven't talked

202
00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:29.419
about that we have on the table here now

203
00:08:29.419 --> 00:08:32.990
is the printer over here this is used

204
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.849
for making a permanent record of things

205
00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:36.620
the computer does after all you might

206
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.020
get a nice report on the screen but it's

207
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.669
very hard to carry away at the end of

208
00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.659
the day the screen does

209
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.699
carry around quite so easily as a piece

210
00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:45.290
of paper so our printer gives you a way

211
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.819
of recording permanently your

212
00:08:46.819 --> 00:08:49.579
information listing out your program so

213
00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:50.959
you can study your programs in your

214
00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:52.430
spare time without having you to have

215
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.500
your computer on and generally is a very

216
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.220
useful accessory so that's the Commodore

217
00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.829
64 as we'd hook it up with some of its

218
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:02.240
accessories but whether you take the

219
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.699
basic unit or whether you add to it

220
00:09:04.699 --> 00:09:06.500
you'll find it's a pretty good machine

221
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.839
we'll talk about it a little bit more in

222
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.439
a few moments

223
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.520
what is a Commodore 64

224
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:23.770
[Music]

225
00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:26.160
I'd like to talk about using the

226
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.320
computer first steps but first of all

227
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.509
I'd like to show you what's inside your

228
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:33.389
Commodore 64 you'll never need to go in

229
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:34.769
there you don't need to give it a lube

230
00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:36.209
job every thousand miles or anything

231
00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.250
like that but you may be curious and

232
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.019
just so you don't have to look in there

233
00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:42.120
I'll show you what's in there in advance

234
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.649
let me open it up I've loosened up the

235
00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.319
screws already and here goes the

236
00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.790
keyboard we'll disconnect the keyboard

237
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.579
connection here hmm that's a tough one

238
00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:54.540
and here comes the pilot light and now

239
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.610
we can see this is the entire computer

240
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.009
on one board let me show you the parts

241
00:09:59.009 --> 00:10:02.670
here we have the 6510 microprocessor

242
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.380
that's the part that adds and

243
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.089
subtraction makes decisions it's a

244
00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:08.430
control center of the computer it's the

245
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.620
heart of everything over here these

246
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.420
chips are called ROM chips

247
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.459
that's where fixed memory is kept the

248
00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:16.500
memory that gives a computer the style

249
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.870
that makes it behave in the way that it

250
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.769
does the big chips over here are

251
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:23.610
input/output chips are often called

252
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.380
interface adapted chips and they're not

253
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.720
terribly important to us except you have

254
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.220
to have input an output or you'll never

255
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.750
be able to send your results anywhere

256
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.000
along the bottom here these little chips

257
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.370
along here are your memory remember we

258
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.430
have 64 K of RAM in a Commodore 64 and

259
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.740
as we come once again back in the loop

260
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.269
we have two chips here which your

261
00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:44.639
interesting this one is called a PLA and

262
00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:46.470
without getting too technical about it

263
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.290
it's the traffic director for the entire

264
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.569
computer it hooks up the right pieces of

265
00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:53.310
memory to the right things at the right

266
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.529
time coming over here this is the sound

267
00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:57.930
interface device chip this is the one

268
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.569
that makes the music and finally inside

269
00:11:00.569 --> 00:11:02.579
this can we Oh circuitry I'd like to

270
00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.170
open this one up once again you should

271
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.620
never do this especially if you have a

272
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.110
plan to play the concert piano okay but

273
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.149
inside what we'll see here is with a

274
00:11:12.149 --> 00:11:14.250
little bit of heat seal gunk on it is a

275
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.470
video chip that actually makes a signal

276
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.199
that goes to your television set or your

277
00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:21.180
monitor if it goes to the television set

278
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.470
it goes through what's called a

279
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.750
modulator in here but that's really

280
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.550
about it the other little chips in there

281
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.170
they're just used to connect the pieces

282
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.089
together logically in fact technicians

283
00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:31.829
often call these little chips glue

284
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:33.089
because they stick the rest of the

285
00:11:33.089 --> 00:11:34.740
computer together but that's all there

286
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.410
is there is

287
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.089
very much we'll put this one back

288
00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:38.949
together and then we'll go and talk

289
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:45.750
about the keyboard getting started

290
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.710
before we start on the details of the

291
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.270
keyboard there's a couple of things on

292
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.740
the screen when you first turn on your

293
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.030
Commodore 64 but I'd like to discuss

294
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.890
first of all you'll notice at the top of

295
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.390
the screen there's a message that says

296
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.940
Commodore 64 basic v2 64 K Ram system

297
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.550
38,000 911 basic bytes free now you

298
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.100
might wonder about that it seems that

299
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.800
you have 64 K machine which is 64

300
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.380
thousand bytes of memory and yet you're

301
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.730
being told that you have slightly less

302
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.750
than 39,000 bytes available well that's

303
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.010
really correct there's nothing wrong

304
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.360
with your machine and there's nothing

305
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.730
missing and you don't have to look for

306
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.350
the parts that fell out of the box it's

307
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.690
all there what happens is that basic

308
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.540
itself only needs about thirty-nine

309
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.390
thousand bytes the extra memory is still

310
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.460
there but it's reserved for other uses

311
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.080
and you'll find that though the other

312
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.140
things that you can use that memory for

313
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.730
39000 is present is plenty for the

314
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.370
average program now the second thing

315
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.410
that you'll see on the screen of your

316
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.530
computer is a flashing square that's

317
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.540
called a cursor and it tells you two

318
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.020
things the first thing it says is the

319
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.930
computer is waiting for you to type and

320
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.120
the second thing it says is when you

321
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.150
type that's where the character which

322
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.720
you type will appear and as you type the

323
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.950
cursor will move along to the next

324
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.350
position so that you'll see wherever it

325
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.730
is that the next character will go as

326
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.380
you type it you'll see where that will

327
00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.660
be so it's an invitation and it's a

328
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.700
location for you and it's called a

329
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.010
cursor now let's talk about this

330
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.500
keyboard here we have here that looks

331
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.050
very much like a conventional typewriter

332
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.300
keyboard it has all those letters in the

333
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.920
center that you can never find on a

334
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.510
typewriter you're gonna have a good time

335
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.240
looking for on your 64 computer at the

336
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.980
top you have the numeric characters

337
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.050
similar to one most typewriters at the

338
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.210
bottom is a spacebar and then we have

339
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.130
much of the punctuation gathered around

340
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.400
it now if I decide to type I can type a

341
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.910
number 457 or if I decide to I can type

342
00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:00.220
a bunch of characters asdfghjkl

343
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.340
CAPITAL LETTERS now that's quite all

344
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.320
right but I'd like to talk about the

345
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.260
next most important key on the keyboard

346
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.700
and that is over here there's a key

347
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.120
marked return now what this key means is

348
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.730
really do it if I press that key

349
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.010
whatever I have just typed the computer

350
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.920
will try to do it now at the moment I

351
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.110
haven't typed anything very sensible on

352
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.450
the computer screen and so if I press

353
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.760
return perhaps the computer might print

354
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.220
some error message it tries to do it and

355
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.870
it can't do it or perhaps it will do

356
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.870
something not very sensible it's very

357
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.490
useful to know that we have when we have

358
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.740
this return key if we don't want to do

359
00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.180
something we just want to go to the next

360
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.920
line you may hold down the shift key

361
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.270
here and then press the return key and

362
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.400
that says don't do it just go and

363
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.990
explain so return says do it

364
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.810
shifted return says just go to the next

365
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.580
line don't try to do anything that we

366
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.160
had there there's several other

367
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.720
important keys here but the ones that

368
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.070
I'd like to just mention briefly in

369
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.620
passing is a function keys which puzzle

370
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.200
a lot of Commodore 64 uses they don't

371
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.690
seem to do anything and in fact at the

372
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.280
moment they really don't do anything

373
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.440
they are there for your programs to

374
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.360
recognize when we write a program or

375
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.190
when we obtain a program from other

376
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.800
places that program will often say press

377
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.560
this key for this effect press this

378
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.660
other key for a different effect and so

379
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.960
what we have involved here is these keys

380
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.390
are available for you to use they aren't

381
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.140
really doing anything right now okay

382
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.580
let's talk about that cursor that

383
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.920
flashing square on the screen we can

384
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.510
move it down by pressing the cursor down

385
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.060
key and there it moved a couple of

386
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.860
spaces but if you hold down the key the

387
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.540
cursor will continue to move we can move

388
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.370
it to the right by pressing the cursor

389
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.560
right key or we can hold it down and it

390
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.780
will continue to move by shifting we can

391
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.150
move the cursor up or to the left and

392
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.160
finally near the top we have a key which

393
00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.840
will home the cursor the key smart to

394
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.360
clear home if we press it the cursor

395
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.460
goes to its home position the upper

396
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.040
left-hand part of the screen on the

397
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.750
other hand if we hold on shift and press

398
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.970
the HOME key it now becomes a clear key

399
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.890
and we will clear the screen a very

400
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.840
useful thing to do when you've got a lot

401
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.070
of junk on the screen and you want to

402
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.810
start over here we go we have

403
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.950
cleared the screen on the computer now

404
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.510
at the moment what have we been doing is

405
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.160
we've been typing alphabetical letters

406
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.880
on the computer and we notice we have a

407
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.710
shift key actually there are two one the

408
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.880
left and one on the right we've hold

409
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.720
down the shift key

410
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.570
we're already typing capital letters so

411
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.910
we won't go from small letters to

412
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.830
capitals we're already there when we

413
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.270
hold down the shift key what we will do

414
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.520
is we will type special graphics

415
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.900
characters you'll see them on the front

416
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.760
of the key if I press an a key for

417
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.770
example holding down the shift I will

418
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.050
see a little Spade character or if I

419
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.000
print the S key holding down the shift I

420
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.160
will see a little heart character so if

421
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.540
you want to write a little program to

422
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.000
play card games there are at least two

423
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.310
of your suits now there are other

424
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.020
graphics in fact there were two graphics

425
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.030
thrown on the front of most peas if you

426
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.829
notice that a has a little corner on us

427
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.660
as well as that Spade key we can get

428
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.370
down one by pressing the commodore key

429
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.199
that's the key with a little commodore

430
00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:13.699
logo to the left of the shift key I'll

431
00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.189
hold that down and we'll press that one

432
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:17.930
and you'll see that the other graphic

433
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.880
comes out when I press the a key so

434
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.880
that's the second kind of shift key now

435
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.470
let me press the don't do it key by

436
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.480
holding down shift and return and now

437
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.160
let's try something a little bit

438
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.360
different because there's a new feature

439
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.190
of the screen that many people don't

440
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.170
know about until they stumble across it

441
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.630
by accident if you hold down the shift

442
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.210
key and while you're holding it down tap

443
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.940
the commodore key the screen changes

444
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.970
gears and now instead of uppercase

445
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.580
characters and graphics

446
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.390
it now has lowercase characters small

447
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.610
letters and uppercase characters big

448
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:53.900
letters which means that if we want to

449
00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.900
type in text or sentences or write a

450
00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.970
letter or things like that we now have

451
00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.040
large and small letters upper and

452
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.450
lowercase so I can now say Jack and Jill

453
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:10.040
went up the hill or something along that

454
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.870
line and put in capital letters word

455
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.880
ever I want to we have that capability

456
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.950
you notice that that wasn't there when

457
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.929
we turn the machine on we did that by

458
00:18:17.929 --> 00:18:19.880
holding down the shift key and tapping

459
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.210
the Commodore key we can go back to

460
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.730
simple uppercase and graphics by doing

461
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.410
it again hold on shift press Commodore

462
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.810
and there we are back to uppercase and

463
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:30.760
graphics

464
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.170
okay let's take a look at some of the

465
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.540
specially marked fronts of this keyboard

466
00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.760
up near the numbers there are eight keys

467
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.650
here from one to eight which are marked

468
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.900
with colors now those are the colors

469
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.490
that we can type on the computer for

470
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.200
example at the moment I'm typing in pale

471
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.120
blue here are some X's and pale blue

472
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.580
we've seen that sort of thing before now

473
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.280
if I hold down the control key which is

474
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.740
a new kind of shift key if I hold it

475
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.320
down and I press for example the number

476
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.750
2 key which is white on the front here

477
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.510
we go now you'll see that the cursor is

478
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.360
blinking white instead of blinking pale

479
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.340
blue and the next time that I type

480
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.190
something those letter in white in fact

481
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.180
they're quite a bit brighter

482
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.730
I can choose many other colors if I want

483
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.460
to for example there's green here and we

484
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.590
can type things in green or whatever we

485
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.180
want to you'll see eight colors marked

486
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.440
on the front and holding the control key

487
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.840
will give you any of those eight but you

488
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.450
have more than eight colors you actually

489
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.030
have sixteen now how in the world do you

490
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.370
get the rest well you get the rest by

491
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.840
instead of holding down the commodore

492
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.370
key instead of poking beyond the control

493
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.830
cage which is up here you hold down the

494
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.480
commodore key which is down here and

495
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.360
then pressing the same colors will now

496
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.600
generate oops let's press it correctly

497
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.970
new colors like grey or that's not a

498
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.830
very good one that's black but we can

499
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.490
choose a whole different style of colors

500
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.710
there's a nice gray well that's our pale

501
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.510
blue again we're back to it again so we

502
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.040
have sixteen possible colors we can

503
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.900
select simply by using these keys in

504
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.480
either the control or the commodore key

505
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.170
to select them now those are the colors

506
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.020
of the characters that we type but there

507
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.550
are other colors that we see appearing

508
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.740
on the screen for example around the

509
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.420
edge of the screen there is a border at

510
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.270
the moment it's pale blue we can change

511
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.340
that border to any color we want but not

512
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.860
by pressing the key instead we must give

513
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.340
a command to the computer here's our

514
00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.260
first command we say change a certain

515
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.620
place in memory to whatever I say and

516
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.930
when you change that place in memory

517
00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.750
then the computer will change its border

518
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.760
color now the place in memory is address

519
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.620
five three two eight all that tells you

520
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.240
which part of memory to use

521
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.960
change memory use the command poke

522
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.940
assess change memory where do we change

523
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.040
what part of memory address five three

524
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.309
to eight oh that's a place and finally

525
00:20:55.309 --> 00:20:57.050
what do we put in there we put a comma

526
00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.170
and then for example let's change the

527
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.640
border of the screen to black we'll type

528
00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.220
in a zero for black that happens to be

529
00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.110
the color code look it up in the book if

530
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.179
you need it and press return and watch

531
00:21:08.179 --> 00:21:12.050
the border it will turn to like if we'd

532
00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.030
rather see the border as white we could

533
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.830
type in the same command again poke five

534
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:19.309
three to eight all comma one one happens

535
00:21:19.309 --> 00:21:21.130
to be the code for white in this case

536
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.570
I'd like to point out that I have put a

537
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.340
command in the computer and now I must

538
00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.040
say do it how do I say that that's the

539
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.860
return key I've typed in the command do

540
00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.720
it and there goes the border to white

541
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.480
now that's one part of the screen the

542
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.370
border there's another part of the

543
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.990
screen whose color we can control and

544
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.090
that is the background behind the

545
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.090
characters remember we've chosen the

546
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.170
colors of the characters individually

547
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.090
there are several color characters on

548
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.710
the screen right now where we can choose

549
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.900
a background color and we do that by

550
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.520
changing a different memory location

551
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.570
poke five three two eight one once again

552
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:57.950
these things are in the book you just

553
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.570
have to know that there's you can go

554
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.250
looking for them what should we change

555
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.350
the background color to well we could

556
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.200
change it to black by selecting color

557
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.600
code zero again and the background goes

558
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.160
from blue now to black so we can control

559
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.630
our border we can draw a background

560
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.640
color and of course we can control the

561
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.410
individual color so that we have on the

562
00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.030
screen let me change the background

563
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.440
color back to blue because I think

564
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.910
that's a rather nice color five three

565
00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.000
two eight one comma and that will be

566
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.190
code six for blue there we go we're back

567
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:31.010
to blue again and now let's talk about

568
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.730
the last couple of things on giving

569
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.960
command so the computer you see we've

570
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.070
given the command we tacked in the

571
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.350
command we finished it but it didn't do

572
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.050
it and so we press return let me show

573
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.160
you a different command the command

574
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.670
print prnt says print something and now

575
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.100
we can put some maybe mathematical

576
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.360
expression behind it and the computer

577
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.280
will do it we'll say print three plus

578
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.100
four and when we press return the

579
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.070
computer which is do it computer says

580
00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.080
I know the print command I know what's

581
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.680
reinforced and the computer prints 7 you

582
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.240
could do a lot of arithmetic this way

583
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.860
once again it's in the book but if we

584
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.350
say if I want to say three times four

585
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.150
I'm going to use the asterisk for

586
00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:12.950
multiplication we use the asterisk sign

587
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:17.530
so 3 times 4 would give us a value of 12

588
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.970
now with that sort of thing remember

589
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.590
typing in the command if you make a

590
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.180
mistake you can back up and correct it

591
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.850
because until you press the return key

592
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.650
computer is noted to it and then you can

593
00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.810
make the command go to work for you now

594
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.040
next time we'll talk about a program

595
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.120
programs are collections of commands

596
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.320
that we can gather together in the

597
00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.510
computer's memory and then we can say to

598
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.850
the computer run this whole collection

599
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.160
of commands we have here we'll talk

600
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.170
about programs next time around

601
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.050
let's run programs

602
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.150
you don't have to write your own

603
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.940
programs for the comp our 64

604
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.010
there are lots and lots of programs

605
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.960
available of all sorts are word

606
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.720
processors there are business program

607
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.890
games languages and all sorts of special

608
00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.920
activities largely the ones that you buy

609
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.820
come in three forms first Kanna form is

610
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.410
in a ROM Peck

611
00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:26.100
this came for example Seawolf inside the

612
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.890
package there's a tiny little rom pack

613
00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.370
containing extra memory inside the

614
00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.990
computer we plug this in the back and

615
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.180
when we do the computer becomes a new

616
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.160
and different kind of machine let's turn

617
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.960
the computer off for a moment which you

618
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.340
must do when you're plugging in a ROM

619
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.650
pack after all you are connecting new

620
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.110
circuitry into the computer we turn it

621
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.750
back on again and instantly the computer

622
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.150
has the new images from Seawolf on a

623
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.090
screen you can see it didn't take any

624
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:55.950
special commands the moment we turned it

625
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.930
on the computer knew it was a new

626
00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.640
machine the machine has been almost

627
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.310
rebuilt by plugging in the ROM pack here

628
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.510
let's turn this off for a moment would

629
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.100
be fun to play the game but we want to

630
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.030
talk about the second way that programs

631
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.860
can come prepackaged their pre available

632
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.500
for you if you have a data set you can

633
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.560
get a program on cassette tape let's put

634
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.240
this cassette tape program into the

635
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.700
computer and in this case when we turn

636
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.390
the computer on the easiest way to start

637
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.430
a cassette program running is to hold

638
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.250
down the shift key here and press run

639
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.050
stop oddly enough it should be the shift

640
00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.060
key closest to the run stop the other

641
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.010
one doesn't seem to work so well so we

642
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.830
hold on shift we tap run stop and now we

643
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.050
see instructions on the screen press

644
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.810
play on tape well there's the data set

645
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.760
tape and we see here's a play button so

646
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.460
we press it and the computer says ok and

647
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.010
then almost instantly the screen blanks

648
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.350
this doesn't mean any kind of failure on

649
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.360
the computer it's simply the computer

650
00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.340
has shut the screen off so that it can

651
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.370
watch tape more carefully in a few

652
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.870
seconds it will have found this program

653
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.180
on tape it says found roots

654
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.460
that's not genealogy that square roots

655
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.710
and we press the commodore key to say ok

656
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.270
go and get it

657
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.610
so what we have now is by pressing the

658
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.250
Komodo key the program has list has list

659
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.440
floated itself into the computer and it

660
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.360
has run here is a table of square roots

661
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.660
from 1 to 20 printed on the screen the

662
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.400
program came from cassette tape this one

663
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.059
here it's now however copied into the

664
00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:34.110
memory of the machine

665
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.840
I've taken the tape out is a program

666
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.330
gone no it's still in random access

667
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.850
memory how can I prove it I'll say run

668
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.270
again are you and the program still in

669
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.740
memory and when I press the return key

670
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.350
to say let's write there goes the

671
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.809
program again there's another table of

672
00:26:51.809 --> 00:26:54.510
square roots so the program once in

673
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.900
memory can be run many many times that's

674
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.250
another way that you can get a program

675
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.990
into the computer let's talk about a

676
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.679
third way here we have some educational

677
00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:06.870
programs put out by Commodore and in

678
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.570
here we have a program which is on disk

679
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.990
this is a program of educational science

680
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.630
programs let's plug this one into the

681
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.910
disk drive here we push it in this way

682
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.460
shiny sign foot side forward label

683
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.440
towards the back we push down the little

684
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.050
door so that's securely in place and now

685
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.660
what we have to do is to just my I

686
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.280
better turn the disk on let me do that

687
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.160
first of all turn the disk on now we'll

688
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.440
plug this diskette in and now we go over

689
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.720
to the computer and say bring in this

690
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.510
program from disk now to do that we must

691
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.030
type in a command called low to Loa D

692
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.429
that always means bring a program into

693
00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:47.220
memory into random access memory in the

694
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.309
disk now we have to say which program

695
00:27:50.309 --> 00:27:53.070
there are many programs on this disk and

696
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.710
we really should say which one in fact

697
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.450
there's a little pamphlet comes along

698
00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.580
with this disk telling you what happens

699
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.290
to be on this disk but at the moment if

700
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.179
you don't know here's a good tip for you

701
00:28:03.179 --> 00:28:05.520
instead of giving a name just give a

702
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.559
name of an asterisk so I'll say load

703
00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:10.080
which I've already typed and then in

704
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.170
quotation marks I'll type asterisk to

705
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.450
say the first program whatever it

706
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.580
happens to be and then behind that will

707
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.650
say comma 8 which means from disk when

708
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.120
we typed it in it looks correct on the

709
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.820
screen then we can press return which is

710
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.460
to do it and here comes the program from

711
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.140
disk now this is quite a large program

712
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.120
it's a fairly big educational program

713
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.610
with animation and so it will take a few

714
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.950
seconds to come in but you'll notice the

715
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.420
difference between this and tape first

716
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.170
of all the screen did not blank second

717
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.880
of all I have to give a name I don't

718
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.740
have to untape because the tape might

719
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.540
just have one program on it or it will

720
00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.890
take the first one to come out but the

721
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.110
disc might have dozens of programs I

722
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.960
often have to say which one I snuck

723
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.640
around at this time by saying the first

724
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.800
one but you often need to know what's on

725
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.320
disk and which program to select you can

726
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.940
take it from the information that comes

727
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.340
with disk or in fact as a way of asking

728
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.950
the disk what's on this particular disk

729
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.360
and you'll get something called a

730
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.310
directory or a catalog well a program is

731
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.720
now ready from disk and that's pretty

732
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.270
fast for a really big program and now if

733
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.820
we say run what we see on the screen is

734
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.980
the first display saying Commodore

735
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.470
educational software press the spacebar

736
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.870
here we go we'll press the spacebar and

737
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.490
now we're going to begin a program

738
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.190
called Boyle's law so this has to do

739
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.710
with gas pressure and we'll press the 1

740
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.950
key and the computer will say well as it

741
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.320
draws a little picture of an amount of

742
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.890
air trapped by a piston ok give us

743
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.660
instructions tell us what we want to do

744
00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.940
ask us what we want to do next we'll

745
00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.370
press the spacebar it will ask us to set

746
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:47.930
the pressure but for the moment we don't

747
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.330
want to run this thing our objective

748
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.070
here is not to learn about Boyle's law

749
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.680
but to learn about how we load programs

750
00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.930
so we'll say we don't want to do that

751
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.750
we'd rather quit and we'll take option

752
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.810
for that says give up and then let's

753
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.580
type it in again there we go I was

754
00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.430
typing too fast and the program is over

755
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.860
now just because I stopped the program

756
00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.530
doesn't mean it's lost from memory let

757
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.200
me review again except for cartridges

758
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.790
which start to run almost immediately

759
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.040
you put them in there are two steps in

760
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.840
making a program go first bringing it in

761
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.670
that calls for a load command Loa D and

762
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.180
secondly once it's in saying run that is

763
00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.400
a command which says whatever has

764
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.700
arrived in memory do it do this

765
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.290
collection of instructions called a

766
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:39.909
program

767
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:42.459
we stopped the program to show bonds law

768
00:30:42.459 --> 00:30:45.059
but we could do it again we could say

769
00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:48.099
run and since the program is still in

770
00:30:48.099 --> 00:30:49.809
memory just because it stopped doesn't

771
00:30:49.809 --> 00:30:50.649
mean it's gone away

772
00:30:50.649 --> 00:30:53.139
if I press run and do it again as I did

773
00:30:53.139 --> 00:30:54.399
with a cassette tape program do you

774
00:30:54.399 --> 00:30:57.249
remember roots the program will run

775
00:30:57.249 --> 00:30:59.709
again and we'll get the same titling

776
00:30:59.709 --> 00:31:02.919
bank now apart from the programs that

777
00:31:02.919 --> 00:31:04.779
you can get commercially you can also

778
00:31:04.779 --> 00:31:08.919
get programs in this form on disk on

779
00:31:08.919 --> 00:31:11.379
cassette tape from other sources from

780
00:31:11.379 --> 00:31:13.690
clubs and from friends and from users

781
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.779
many programs are generally available

782
00:31:16.779 --> 00:31:18.399
are public domain you won't have any

783
00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:19.929
problem getting them but there are other

784
00:31:19.929 --> 00:31:21.849
sources you can go to if you want

785
00:31:21.849 --> 00:31:24.069
programs for example there are many

786
00:31:24.069 --> 00:31:26.349
books containing programs we pick up

787
00:31:26.349 --> 00:31:28.329
books here we'll find that there are all

788
00:31:28.329 --> 00:31:30.099
sorts of programs for doing various

789
00:31:30.099 --> 00:31:32.319
things typed into the computer and we

790
00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:34.389
could type in these program instructions

791
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:38.409
and the program would run similarly even

792
00:31:38.409 --> 00:31:40.690
the Commodore 64 users guide the one

793
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.869
that comes packed in the box contains

794
00:31:43.869 --> 00:31:46.059
programs that we may type into the

795
00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:48.219
computer and gives us examples of how we

796
00:31:48.219 --> 00:31:50.019
can make certain things happen let's see

797
00:31:50.019 --> 00:31:51.369
if you can find one here here's a

798
00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:53.469
program for example down this one if we

799
00:31:53.469 --> 00:31:56.440
type in these instructions then and say

800
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.989
run we'll have a program in our computer

801
00:31:58.989 --> 00:32:01.599
in fact we have plenty of books of this

802
00:32:01.599 --> 00:32:04.119
sort and we also have many magazines

803
00:32:04.119 --> 00:32:06.129
some are published monthly some not

804
00:32:06.129 --> 00:32:09.369
quite so often which contained many many

805
00:32:09.369 --> 00:32:11.289
programs of various things all of these

806
00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:14.319
magazines are published with plenty of

807
00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:16.690
programs and we can take these various

808
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:20.129
magazines put in the programs and

809
00:32:20.129 --> 00:32:22.989
eventually we'll have a running program

810
00:32:22.989 --> 00:32:24.879
by typing these in now one thing I'd

811
00:32:24.879 --> 00:32:26.079
like to point out to you however it is

812
00:32:26.079 --> 00:32:29.109
these programs are pretty big if you

813
00:32:29.109 --> 00:32:31.409
take a program like this one for example

814
00:32:31.409 --> 00:32:34.539
which is for the 64 it starts on this

815
00:32:34.539 --> 00:32:36.819
page and then continue through all of

816
00:32:36.819 --> 00:32:39.459
these pages through you can see that's a

817
00:32:39.459 --> 00:32:42.279
lot of typing now it's probably a very

818
00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:44.379
good game program so you'll probably

819
00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:46.629
have quite a good time playing the game

820
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:48.789
once you've typed it all in but typing

821
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:50.829
in that huge amount of material means a

822
00:32:50.829 --> 00:32:53.090
couple of problems first of all a lot of

823
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.370
a careful work and secondly possibly a

824
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:56.720
couple of mistakes that you'll have to

825
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.820
look for and correct if the program

826
00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.580
doesn't run correctly now that's okay

827
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.290
it's a good game you've spent a lot of

828
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.940
time you type it in you run it you say

829
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.620
what a wonderful game but if you shut

830
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.920
the computer off the programs gone

831
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.650
there's nothing left and the next time

832
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.150
you turn your computer on the next day

833
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.380
or the next week or whatever and you

834
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.940
want to do that program again guess what

835
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.790
you'd have to type it all and again well

836
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.250
you don't have to there's a way once you

837
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.140
have typed or entered a program into the

838
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.560
computer once it's ready and running

839
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.480
reasonably well you can then copy it

840
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.230
onto a cassette tape or onto floppy disk

841
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.320
and then bring the program back any time

842
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.650
you want to we call that copying save in

843
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.670
other words we can tell the computer

844
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.010
once the program is ready save that

845
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.650
program on to cassette tape save that

846
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.930
program on a floppy disk and the program

847
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.850
will be there and we'll then we won't

848
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.200
have to type it in the next time we can

849
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.060
just call it up from where we have

850
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.730
placed it in storage now there's one

851
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.010
other way you can get a program apart

852
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.800
from buying it and getting it on disk or

853
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.170
tape or typing in from a magazine and

854
00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.080
that is you can write a program yourself

855
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.400
but to do that we'll have to talk a

856
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.590
little more about what a program really

857
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.670
is and we'll do that next time

858
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:17.899
[Music]

859
00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:21.519
what makes programs work

860
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.369
in order to use a computer effectively

861
00:34:29.369 --> 00:34:31.760
it's useful to know how a program works

862
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.020
that's what we'll talk about here you

863
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.810
may recall that previously we looked at

864
00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.780
entering in direct commands into the

865
00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.970
computer for example I could say print

866
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:47.310
33 + 44 on the computer would reply 77

867
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:50.040
that's called a direct command

868
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.050
we could put exactly the same type of

869
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.840
command into a program at which case we

870
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.520
would call it a statement and it would

871
00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.280
be stored and used later not used right

872
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.830
away so here's what we might do in order

873
00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.630
to store a command we put a number in

874
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.040
front of it I might put a number here

875
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.859
100 and then behind it the same command

876
00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:11.070
prints 3 3 + 44 and when I press return

877
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:14.070
the computer instead of performing the

878
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.160
command will store it away and then we

879
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.260
can use it at a later time command we

880
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.790
didn't print the answer now the

881
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.790
instruction is stored now if you want to

882
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.220
enter a program you have to be careful

883
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.710
first of all that any old programs you

884
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.869
have in there are disposed of you don't

885
00:35:30.869 --> 00:35:32.490
want them sitting around you want to

886
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.980
start with an absolutely fresh computer

887
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.680
so you say wipe out the old programs by

888
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.490
typing in the word new and II W now

889
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.950
we're ready to type in the instructions

890
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.170
of our own program we're using a simple

891
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.890
language which is called basic basic has

892
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.410
simple commands such as print input

893
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:54.540
we've seen some of them before you'll

894
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.940
find many of them in the Commodore 65

895
00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:02.460
user's guide now let's take a look at

896
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.740
why we would store commands why do we

897
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.240
only just type the code in and get the

898
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.080
work done right away

899
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.880
well it turns out that when you gather

900
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.040
commands together into the computer's

901
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.950
memory as a program some brand-new

902
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.390
things start happening that you don't

903
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.020
get with direct commands these basic

904
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.760
statements can work together in a

905
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.460
brand-new way there are of course always

906
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.260
the commands that do things the commands

907
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.790
that print the comments that calculate

908
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.220
and so on there are some new kinds of

909
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.350
commands for example there's one set of

910
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.080
commands that's good for creating

911
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.880
repetition so we can do something over

912
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.880
and over again here's the idea once we

913
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.500
start

914
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.500
and into the computer's memory we can do

915
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.690
it as many times as we want hundreds of

916
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:46.490
times we don't have to put it in again

917
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.630
if we can only bring in repetition what

918
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.070
some people call looping because the

919
00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:55.010
program goes back and repeats again then

920
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.690
we can use that program statement over

921
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.500
and over again and save a lot of work

922
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.510
second thing that we have here is the

923
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.030
ability to use some instructions and not

924
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.810
use others let me give you an example

925
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.340
suppose that we're printing out a large

926
00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.190
number of customer bills and we have

927
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:16.070
written into our program to say print on

928
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:18.440
the bill your bill is now overdue please

929
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.320
pay promptly now we don't want to use

930
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.290
that communication every time there are

931
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.170
some communications there are some

932
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.120
customers who will have their bills up

933
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.770
to date and you don't want to print that

934
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.090
message so here's what we need in the

935
00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.210
computer we need decision we can decide

936
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:39.970
yes we'll perform this activity or no

937
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.500
we'll skip over it and go on to the next

938
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.780
part so here are the three parts first

939
00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.190
of all the action part the part that

940
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:47.140
does things

941
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.060
second of all the repetition part the

942
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.860
part that goes back and does the same

943
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.660
thing for the next customer or the next

944
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.180
item of information and thirdly the

945
00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.280
decision part saying in some cases

946
00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.070
perform this piece of info at these set

947
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.380
of instructions in other cases don't

948
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.440
skip them now with all of those we can

949
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.450
have the flexibility we need in our

950
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:10.190
computer now there's one more thing

951
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.260
that's useful to know when we're talking

952
00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.350
about how a computer handles information

953
00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:19.820
and that is variables suppose we have

954
00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.680
some calculation we want to do but when

955
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.630
we wrote the right to program we won't

956
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.160
know what the numbers are

957
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.140
we won't know what the sales results are

958
00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.120
until they come in and we're writing the

959
00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.710
program beforehand we won't know the

960
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.200
customers name because the customer

961
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.180
might have to walk in until a month

962
00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.220
after we finished writing the program so

963
00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.080
what we have to do in the program is we

964
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.480
have to leave blanks in the program and

965
00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.090
say we'll fill these blanks in later and

966
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:46.400
we can tell the program to work on these

967
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.440
blanks and make all of this stuff work

968
00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.420
at the time now these blanks are called

969
00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.730
there

970
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:56.100
in basic anything that we give a name to

971
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.970
is a variable for example I can say x

972
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:04.860
equals 123 when I press return to say do

973
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.500
that calculation the variable called X

974
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.790
will be stored somewhere in the

975
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.920
computer's memory and that will hold a

976
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.400
value of 123 but anytime later we can

977
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.610
say to the computer print X and the

978
00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:19.740
computer will look in its memory find

979
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.380
the variable or the blank we have filled

980
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:27.630
in called X and predator you 123 in fact

981
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.070
we can do more than that we could say

982
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.430
print x plus 100 and when the computer

983
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:37.110
goes into its memory it will print 223

984
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.119
it fetched the value of x and then

985
00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:40.880
performed the rest of the arithmetic

986
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.380
these variables these things to be

987
00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.240
filled in later are very important if we

988
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.740
didn't have them the computer would

989
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.480
almost have to calculate on the same

990
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.580
numbers every time but there's more than

991
00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.980
numbers they're also names we can store

992
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.980
names and addresses and codes and

993
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.280
anything we want to in a none numeric

994
00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.460
fashion we call this kind of thing a

995
00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:06.150
string variable let me show you one if I

996
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.630
say X with a dollar sign behind it what

997
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:13.020
I mean is this is not a conventional

998
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.450
variable for use in arithmetic so that a

999
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:19.830
number instead we have a name okay let's

1000
00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.050
take a look we say X string equals well

1001
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:23.940
we can put on a name Jim Butterfield and

1002
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.340
once again Y press return the computer

1003
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.119
will say okay I'm now holding a filled

1004
00:40:30.119 --> 00:40:32.850
in blank area called X frame and filled

1005
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.859
into that space is the name Jim

1006
00:40:34.859 --> 00:40:38.250
Butterfield no these things work

1007
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.600
together with the blanks that we can

1008
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.330
fill in called variables and we'll the

1009
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:44.670
control features that we have the

1010
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.580
repetition and the decision we can write

1011
00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.730
a program to do almost anything in a

1012
00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.010
moment we'll talk about how we can fill

1013
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:56.359
programs into the computer

1014
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:03.410
putting programs to work

1015
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.030
if you want to enter programs into the

1016
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.370
computer either because you write them

1017
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:12.910
yourself

1018
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.610
or because you read them from a magazine

1019
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.190
or book then the few things that would

1020
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.710
be useful for you to know as you know

1021
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.980
you're gonna put in your program lines

1022
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.300
starting with a line number that's a

1023
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.410
number ahead of the line which says

1024
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.390
don't do this now save it and we'll do

1025
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.430
it later for example we could say a

1026
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.960
given statement here

1027
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.100
now we could type it in and when we

1028
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.140
press return that would be the end of it

1029
00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.980
now what happens if you make a mistake

1030
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.540
well the easiest thing if you haven't

1031
00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.000
press return if a line isn't in yet then

1032
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.680
you can use the Delete key and go back

1033
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.820
and you won't have to worry about the

1034
00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.200
mistake it will never have been added

1035
00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.870
into the computer okay now we can finish

1036
00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.120
this line and when it's finished then we

1037
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.460
press return now the lines in the

1038
00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.560
computer and if we have a mistake on it

1039
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.810
now there are several things we can do

1040
00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.090
first of all if you see anything wrong

1041
00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.700
with a line that you typed in all you

1042
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.080
have to do is to type the line and again

1043
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.300
correct it if I put it in again

1044
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.160
the moment I press return the old line

1045
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.960
is removed in the new line that I typed

1046
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.869
in will replace it it recognizes that

1047
00:42:29.869 --> 00:42:31.250
that's the line to be replaced because

1048
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:34.130
it carries the same number the old line

1049
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:37.400
100 is gone the new one is there in a

1050
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.930
moment we'll talk about what happens if

1051
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.430
you miss out of line but here's

1052
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.799
something that's very useful since you

1053
00:42:42.799 --> 00:42:44.809
often forget to put a couple of things

1054
00:42:44.809 --> 00:42:46.789
at the beginning of your program it's

1055
00:42:46.789 --> 00:42:48.680
usually fairly good to start with a

1056
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.980
moderately high line number like 100 and

1057
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.079
since you may omit things that you need

1058
00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:56.269
to do within your program you should

1059
00:42:56.269 --> 00:42:58.130
skip the numbers along perhaps ten at a

1060
00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.190
time starting at 100 going through 110

1061
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.079
and so on let's type some more material

1062
00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:12.039
in here real time okay now somewhere

1063
00:43:12.039 --> 00:43:15.549
somewhere along this line we say okay

1064
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:18.619
we've typed in a program line we've made

1065
00:43:18.619 --> 00:43:19.970
a mistake there's something the matter

1066
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.009
with it another thing we can do rather

1067
00:43:22.009 --> 00:43:25.539
than typing over is we can go back and

1068
00:43:25.539 --> 00:43:30.890
we can type in a correction right on the

1069
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.910
screen and even though we haven't typed

1070
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.700
in the whole line pressing return enters

1071
00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.309
a whole line all over again so that when

1072
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:41.930
we make a mistake we can correct it

1073
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.160
right on the screen without having to

1074
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.960
type the entire line this is called

1075
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.180
screen editing it's a very useful

1076
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.799
feature of the things so we'll enter

1077
00:43:48.799 --> 00:43:56.240
some more lines and I will say print ok

1078
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.769
we've entered several lines into our

1079
00:43:57.769 --> 00:43:59.869
program at any time we can look at what

1080
00:43:59.869 --> 00:44:03.019
we have entered by saying list L is T

1081
00:44:03.019 --> 00:44:06.049
and we'll see a list of the lines we've

1082
00:44:06.049 --> 00:44:08.690
put in remember before you start you

1083
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:10.400
should saying you to clear the computer

1084
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.140
of any old lines that are in there now

1085
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.630
if I decide I want to insert a line that

1086
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:17.150
I've missed in between say a couple of

1087
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.819
lines that are already on there all I

1088
00:44:19.819 --> 00:44:21.140
have to do is to pick a line number

1089
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.289
that's in between put a line between 110

1090
00:44:24.289 --> 00:44:27.980
and 115 for example out of 110 or 120

1091
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.440
I'll enter a line 115

1092
00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.940
and the new line will take its place and

1093
00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.769
the old lines will move over to make

1094
00:44:39.769 --> 00:44:42.709
room one last thing if it's some reason

1095
00:44:42.709 --> 00:44:43.940
you have a line of coating in there

1096
00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.009
which is wrong or you simply want to

1097
00:44:46.009 --> 00:44:47.989
take out entirely you can remove any

1098
00:44:47.989 --> 00:44:50.269
line by typing in its line number and

1099
00:44:50.269 --> 00:44:52.849
typing nothing behind it just return so

1100
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:54.950
if we don't want line 120 which have

1101
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.979
been 120 and then press return and that

1102
00:44:57.979 --> 00:44:58.910
line is gone

1103
00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.789
once again at any time we can list now

1104
00:45:01.789 --> 00:45:03.529
if this is our final program there were

1105
00:45:03.529 --> 00:45:04.969
several things that we can do with the

1106
00:45:04.969 --> 00:45:06.709
program is ready now this is not a very

1107
00:45:06.709 --> 00:45:11.299
big one we can say run and the program

1108
00:45:11.299 --> 00:45:12.950
will run that's a pretty short program

1109
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.299
and doesn't do anything terribly

1110
00:45:14.299 --> 00:45:16.880
exciting if we'd like to take away a

1111
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.459
copy of our program for study and we

1112
00:45:19.459 --> 00:45:21.890
have a printer we can transfer a listing

1113
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.380
of that program to the printer how to do

1114
00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.910
it is in the book and in the printer

1115
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:28.640
guide it's a rather curious series of

1116
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.229
statements where we have to first of all

1117
00:45:30.229 --> 00:45:32.049
make a connection to the printer and

1118
00:45:32.049 --> 00:45:37.069
then we say let's divert all of the

1119
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:38.420
things that would normally go to the

1120
00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.459
screen will divert them over the printer

1121
00:45:40.459 --> 00:45:44.989
instead and now we're ready we'll say

1122
00:45:44.989 --> 00:45:46.880
list and instead of listening to the

1123
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.709
screen the computer will list to the

1124
00:45:48.709 --> 00:45:51.369
printer here we go

1125
00:45:54.459 --> 00:45:57.170
and there's our program on the printer

1126
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:58.880
we can tear it off take away study it

1127
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.130
and decide what we want to do next if

1128
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.259
you ever do this you should terminate

1129
00:46:03.259 --> 00:46:04.819
this procedure with a print number for

1130
00:46:04.819 --> 00:46:07.219
that disconnects the printer now as well

1131
00:46:07.219 --> 00:46:09.799
as doing that once we have this program

1132
00:46:09.799 --> 00:46:12.410
ready we'll probably want to keep it so

1133
00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:14.930
that the next time around we don't have

1134
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:17.359
to type it in again here's how we do it

1135
00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:19.609
on cassette tape we say that word safe

1136
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:22.309
by itself that would be enough but we

1137
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:25.910
can do more we can give it a name I'll

1138
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:27.769
call this program hi there so we'll say

1139
00:46:27.769 --> 00:46:31.400
save in quotation marks hi there and the

1140
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.799
moment that I press return I get the

1141
00:46:33.799 --> 00:46:36.079
instruction press record and play on the

1142
00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:38.660
tape because that tape is already inside

1143
00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.489
the machine so I'll press record and

1144
00:46:40.489 --> 00:46:43.099
play and the screen blanks which is what

1145
00:46:43.099 --> 00:46:45.140
always happens when we're reading or

1146
00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.630
I ain't ate in a few moments this is a

1147
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:49.880
fairly short program so in 15 seconds is

1148
00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.190
so the tape will stop and the screen

1149
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.079
will return to us and then we'll talk

1150
00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:56.569
about doing exactly the same thing when

1151
00:46:56.569 --> 00:47:01.279
we save this thing onto disk okay the

1152
00:47:01.279 --> 00:47:03.019
program is seyd I'll simply stop the

1153
00:47:03.019 --> 00:47:05.150
cassette tape here and now we'll take a

1154
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:07.640
disk place it in a disk file and we'll

1155
00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.279
do exactly the same thing making copy of

1156
00:47:10.279 --> 00:47:12.920
this program to disk we type in almost

1157
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.170
the same command this time we must have

1158
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.420
a name everything going on to disk must

1159
00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.890
have a name because we can save so many

1160
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.589
things on disk and so we say save hi

1161
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:23.390
there but we also have to say one more

1162
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.720
thing comma 8 8 is the device number of

1163
00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.519
the disk when we want to save to the

1164
00:47:28.519 --> 00:47:32.599
disk we say save program name comma 8

1165
00:47:32.599 --> 00:47:35.119
and out it goes I'll press return the

1166
00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:37.099
disk will start to spin the light will

1167
00:47:37.099 --> 00:47:39.049
come on the program is being written and

1168
00:47:39.049 --> 00:47:43.309
now the process is complete it was a lot

1169
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:45.140
faster than on cassette tape but of

1170
00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.430
course that's one of the things that you

1171
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.329
get when you buy a floppy disk next time

1172
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:52.400
we'll talk about how programs can store

1173
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.470
data on disk or tape for you this is

1174
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:55.940
storing data we've seen how to store

1175
00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.769
programs now we'll take a look at the

1176
00:47:57.769 --> 00:48:00.069
next step

1177
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.730
storing information

1178
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:08.670
[Music]

1179
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:13.209
this time I'd like to talk about how we

1180
00:48:13.209 --> 00:48:16.059
store data so that we can use it later

1181
00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.519
we'll normally start it on floppy disk

1182
00:48:18.519 --> 00:48:21.579
or cassette tape there's an interesting

1183
00:48:21.579 --> 00:48:23.619
difference between programs courts start

1184
00:48:23.619 --> 00:48:26.920
on disk on tape and data start the same

1185
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.349
way programs tend to remain about the

1186
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:31.119
same once you've written the program it

1187
00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:33.190
shouldn't need changing unless you find

1188
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:34.690
there's a mistake in it or there's some

1189
00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.489
change in your practice and doing

1190
00:48:36.489 --> 00:48:37.779
whatever it is that you're doing and you

1191
00:48:37.779 --> 00:48:39.759
need to keep a new kind of information

1192
00:48:39.759 --> 00:48:42.339
but your data files will be changing all

1193
00:48:42.339 --> 00:48:44.289
the time as customers come and go as

1194
00:48:44.289 --> 00:48:46.209
they pay their accounts as they charge

1195
00:48:46.209 --> 00:48:48.880
new things or as you add to your record

1196
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.259
library or whatever you're keeping track

1197
00:48:50.259 --> 00:48:52.690
of your data files will be changing all

1198
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.160
the time that's what they're there for

1199
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.380
ok but they can be kept in exactly the

1200
00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.450
same way as we keep programs on this

1201
00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:00.009
sort of stuff now I'd like to talk about

1202
00:49:00.009 --> 00:49:03.069
the general set up the information

1203
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:04.930
stored on there it's not just a formless

1204
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.420
massive information it's arranged in a

1205
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:10.029
certain way if you look inside a filing

1206
00:49:10.029 --> 00:49:12.160
cabinet you could probably pull out one

1207
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.569
of those filing folders and you would

1208
00:49:13.569 --> 00:49:15.069
call what you had there a file and

1209
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:17.049
that's what we call these things on the

1210
00:49:17.049 --> 00:49:19.509
computer collections of information are

1211
00:49:19.509 --> 00:49:21.940
called files but they do have a certain

1212
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.829
structure if you open up your filing

1213
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:25.719
folders you would see a number of sheets

1214
00:49:25.719 --> 00:49:27.400
each dealing with a certain sort of

1215
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.380
thing it might deal with a student it

1216
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.670
might deal with a customer and might

1217
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:32.559
deal with a sale it might deal with a

1218
00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:34.869
book in your library and what we call

1219
00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:36.609
those if we say well I have a record on

1220
00:49:36.609 --> 00:49:38.619
this book and I gonna put a record in

1221
00:49:38.619 --> 00:49:39.880
here about this new book that I just

1222
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:42.339
bought we call these items of the

1223
00:49:42.339 --> 00:49:43.979
information about a certain thing

1224
00:49:43.979 --> 00:49:46.719
records and that's exactly what we call

1225
00:49:46.719 --> 00:49:48.369
them on the computer each file contains

1226
00:49:48.369 --> 00:49:50.829
a number of records information about

1227
00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:54.369
things within each record we have a lot

1228
00:49:54.369 --> 00:49:56.049
of details some of the detail is

1229
00:49:56.049 --> 00:49:58.509
constant some of its changes we have for

1230
00:49:58.509 --> 00:50:02.140
example a person's name a person's age

1231
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.349
their customer balance whatever it is

1232
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:07.119
and so on and some of these fields are

1233
00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:08.799
relatively constant they hardly ever

1234
00:50:08.799 --> 00:50:11.049
change for example a customer's name

1235
00:50:11.049 --> 00:50:12.940
doesn't change much customer's age

1236
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.619
doesn't change until they start getting

1237
00:50:14.619 --> 00:50:16.779
past 50 then it starts the birth date

1238
00:50:16.779 --> 00:50:18.400
starts moving back a little bit and

1239
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.959
working up a little bit but in any case

1240
00:50:19.959 --> 00:50:22.599
we have fairly fixed information we also

1241
00:50:22.599 --> 00:50:23.700
have very

1242
00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.339
information as a purchase sinks as they

1243
00:50:26.339 --> 00:50:28.619
pay their accounts some of these other

1244
00:50:28.619 --> 00:50:31.410
fields change quite rapidly each of

1245
00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:33.060
these fields then come together to make

1246
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.920
up a record a unit of information on

1247
00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.420
certain things we may have a lot of

1248
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.430
records in the database of only a few I

1249
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:42.510
suppose if you set up a file on the LPS

1250
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.849
that you have in your stereo system then

1251
00:50:44.849 --> 00:50:46.710
you'd call these things about records

1252
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.060
about records but whatever they are

1253
00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.310
you'll have one for each one of the are

1254
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:52.349
the items you're logging they come

1255
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:55.230
together to make a file that is one more

1256
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:56.790
level if you have a collection of files

1257
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:59.040
that work together for example you have

1258
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.400
a group of sales transactions excuse me

1259
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.680
you have a bunch of sales transactions

1260
00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:07.710
which are on one particular file and on

1261
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:09.599
different file you have customer names

1262
00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:12.030
and addresses when you want to process

1263
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:13.710
those you might be bringing in the sales

1264
00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:15.599
transactions here and bringing in the

1265
00:51:15.599 --> 00:51:17.310
customer names and addresses and making

1266
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:19.290
them work together to print bills or

1267
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:20.430
whatever you're trying to put together

1268
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:22.680
now when files work together we usually

1269
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.190
call that arrangements at database we'll

1270
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:28.440
be talking here about sequential files

1271
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.950
and we'll be putting some of these into

1272
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:34.200
our computer we can put those onto disk

1273
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.819
we can put those on a tape and we'll do

1274
00:51:35.819 --> 00:51:38.280
a simple example of that sort of thing

1275
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.660
but one thing I'd like to point out

1276
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.150
first of all is the we write programs we

1277
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.180
type them in on the machine but we don't

1278
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.460
write files programs arrange to write

1279
00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.650
this information on Disko tape and we

1280
00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.230
give the information to programs so we

1281
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:54.420
write programs and programs write finals

1282
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.130
that's generally how it works

1283
00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:58.200
now let's take a look at the type of

1284
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.060
file called a sequential file it's one

1285
00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.190
thing stored behind together we can see

1286
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:03.660
that's the way it has to happen on

1287
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.910
cassette tape because the tape reels

1288
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:07.410
along and if you want to put record

1289
00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:09.420
number 50 in there it will have to fit

1290
00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.240
behind record number 49 the same is

1291
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.280
often true of disk we have sequential

1292
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.380
files on disk that means if we want to

1293
00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.900
search for a certain record we'll have

1294
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.730
to wade through all the ones which are

1295
00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:22.980
in front that's usually no problem the

1296
00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.480
computer is pretty fast and it'll find

1297
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.740
the record you want without too much

1298
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:26.160
trouble

1299
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.690
there is a special kind of file

1300
00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:29.069
available for this called a relative

1301
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:31.829
file it's somewhat more powerful but

1302
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:33.839
it's somewhat less common we won't talk

1303
00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:36.270
about it here in the moment and by the

1304
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:37.630
way a relative file isn't

1305
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:39.789
a collection of your cousins and uncles

1306
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:41.650
that live in other cities let's talk

1307
00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:45.130
about how we write a file here I have a

1308
00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:47.410
program in here which is about to write

1309
00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:48.880
a final I'd like to show you it's I'm

1310
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.410
going to write the file on this cassette

1311
00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:52.630
tape that we have here we'll close the

1312
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:54.819
door so the tape is ready to go I'll say

1313
00:52:54.819 --> 00:52:56.859
run for the program and now the program

1314
00:52:56.859 --> 00:52:59.769
says are we ready to start tape yes we

1315
00:52:59.769 --> 00:53:02.680
are because the tapes ready to go and so

1316
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.049
we'll say yes this is a program that

1317
00:53:05.049 --> 00:53:06.789
wants us to give it five names that

1318
00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:08.799
we'll write five names for our bowling

1319
00:53:08.799 --> 00:53:10.569
league on there it says press record and

1320
00:53:10.569 --> 00:53:12.640
play on tape yes we have to do that

1321
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.220
ourselves there we go the screen blanks

1322
00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.690
as it usually does when there's tape

1323
00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:19.299
activity going and in a few moments

1324
00:53:19.299 --> 00:53:20.920
after the header is written this is

1325
00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.690
written with the name of the file and

1326
00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.849
says hey what's coming behind this point

1327
00:53:24.849 --> 00:53:28.269
will be a data file in a moment the

1328
00:53:28.269 --> 00:53:29.680
screen comes back and the program

1329
00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.750
continues and it says enter five names

1330
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:34.329
well I suppose we can say the first name

1331
00:53:34.329 --> 00:53:36.819
will be Bob and it won't be Carol next

1332
00:53:36.819 --> 00:53:38.380
one might be Ted the next one might be

1333
00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:41.589
Alice and the last name might be Leroy

1334
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:44.500
but the interesting thing here is a1

1335
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.390
I've been typing in these names the

1336
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:50.170
cassette tape hasn't moved what happened

1337
00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:51.609
I'm typing all all of these names

1338
00:53:51.609 --> 00:53:53.859
they're being sent to the file and yet

1339
00:53:53.859 --> 00:53:55.539
we don't hear them on here well what

1340
00:53:55.539 --> 00:53:58.329
happens is this that the information

1341
00:53:58.329 --> 00:54:00.819
isn't written on tape as it's generated

1342
00:54:00.819 --> 00:54:03.220
it's collected and only when you have a

1343
00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.230
certain block of information to make it

1344
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:08.200
worth writing tape will you do that the

1345
00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.660
information is held in a storage area in

1346
00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:12.640
the computer called a buffer in this

1347
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.329
case now when I write the last name then

1348
00:54:16.329 --> 00:54:18.160
the tape will start to move and so our

1349
00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.200
special press return name number five is

1350
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.480
in there and the tape is now moving

1351
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.069
you'll notice the screen has blanked

1352
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:26.140
once again and in a few moments that

1353
00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.519
data will be completed it will be

1354
00:54:27.519 --> 00:54:30.039
written on tape and now it's on our

1355
00:54:30.039 --> 00:54:32.890
front let's stop the tape let's rewind

1356
00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:37.599
it and take it out for the moment that

1357
00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:39.940
data is written here now even if I turn

1358
00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.680
off my computer we can bring it back

1359
00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:44.289
from that magnetic tape anytime we want

1360
00:54:44.289 --> 00:54:47.799
to okay it's relatively permanent now

1361
00:54:47.799 --> 00:54:50.200
let's see if we can read it back in the

1362
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.369
computer program said

1363
00:54:51.369 --> 00:54:52.839
like to rewind it and play back and I'll

1364
00:54:52.839 --> 00:54:55.420
say sure I want to do that it says now

1365
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:58.410
press play on tape not playing record

1366
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.059
and now we'll take a little time first

1367
00:55:01.059 --> 00:55:03.009
of all the cassette tape has to look for

1368
00:55:03.009 --> 00:55:04.960
the program header remember we wrote a

1369
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.970
header with a name of that data file on

1370
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.849
it and after that it will then go for

1371
00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:12.190
the block that contains the data bring

1372
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:14.740
it back and print it on the screen okay

1373
00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.900
we just finished going by the header in

1374
00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.240
another seven or eight seconds or so we

1375
00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.160
will have our data back from that

1376
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.170
cassette tape and here it is Bob Carol

1377
00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:25.509
Ted Allison Leroy we have started on

1378
00:55:25.509 --> 00:55:28.079
tape we have got it back successfully

1379
00:55:28.079 --> 00:55:30.490
once again we'll stop and rewind the

1380
00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:34.749
tape okay what have we found out from

1381
00:55:34.749 --> 00:55:36.490
that well that we can write information

1382
00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:39.609
quite successfully to a cassette tape we

1383
00:55:39.609 --> 00:55:41.680
could do almost exactly the same thing

1384
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.710
to disk this is a data file it is no

1385
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:46.869
longer a program file but it writes in

1386
00:55:46.869 --> 00:55:49.599
approximately the same way we should

1387
00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:52.119
keep very closely in mind what we have

1388
00:55:52.119 --> 00:55:54.430
going here in terms of the structure of

1389
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:57.489
a file in this case we have only one

1390
00:55:57.489 --> 00:55:59.440
field inside the record just a name and

1391
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.150
that's each record this could be our

1392
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:04.390
bowling team if for example Ted decided

1393
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.160
to opt out we could replace that name

1394
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.660
and write a new file and so on because

1395
00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.940
files are made to be changed as are

1396
00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:13.089
needed that's enough about file for the

1397
00:56:13.089 --> 00:56:14.619
moment next thing I'd like to talk about

1398
00:56:14.619 --> 00:56:18.190
is a Commodore 64 used as a tool for

1399
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:21.269
education and

1400
00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:48.990
the Commodore 64 as a learning tool

1401
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:54.810
computers are often good in a classroom

1402
00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:56.550
environment certainly there's a lot of

1403
00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:59.160
excitement in education students seem to

1404
00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.350
like computers very often the most

1405
00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:03.120
common thing we see computers used for

1406
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.610
is drill and practice a computer puts a

1407
00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:07.320
question to the student the student

1408
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.000
answers a question then another question

1409
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.130
gets placed and so on if the student

1410
00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.020
gives an incorrect answer perhaps the

1411
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.390
correct answer will be shown this sort

1412
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:17.430
of thing is called computer assisted

1413
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:22.140
instruction which is abbreviated CAI now

1414
00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.550
there are some people in education who

1415
00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:24.660
feel that the students should not be

1416
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.360
forced into too narrow a channel and

1417
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.340
that the computer has many more uses in

1418
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:31.590
pure drill and practice they like to

1419
00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:33.270
talk about the general environment where

1420
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:35.670
a computer can help any learning process

1421
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:37.890
whether as a supportive device whether

1422
00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:41.120
in simulations whether in even game-like

1423
00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.400
situations that's usually called by a

1424
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.720
slightly different name computer

1425
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:50.220
assisted learning or si al whichever way

1426
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.960
you go the teacher in the classroom now

1427
00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.990
finds himself or herself in a rather

1428
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:56.820
strange position first of all you have

1429
00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.370
great enthusiasm great energy on the

1430
00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:01.500
part of their students but the teachers

1431
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.480
themselves feel that it's perhaps

1432
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.790
difficult for them to learn to be expert

1433
00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:08.730
programmers in order to deal with the

1434
00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:11.640
material that they want to teach what

1435
00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.440
can they do should teachers become

1436
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.450
programmers should program has become

1437
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:18.270
teachers it's not an easy question to

1438
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:21.060
answer the average classroom teacher

1439
00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:23.100
does have a few things to do the teacher

1440
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.850
can by teaching programs by software

1441
00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:28.440
which can be used in the classroom

1442
00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:32.280
if suitable material can be found the

1443
00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.990
teacher can even challenge students to

1444
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:38.040
prepare the material and try let's say

1445
00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.750
let's have a contest and say whoever can

1446
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.340
write the best teaching program gets a

1447
00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.070
prize they get to write another one

1448
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:45.870
something useful like that you'd be

1449
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:47.430
surprised at what a reward that can be

1450
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:50.040
for students and finally there are some

1451
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:53.850
attempts to make teaching or preparing

1452
00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:56.670
teaching materials on a computer easier

1453
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:58.950
there are specialized languages such as

1454
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:01.350
pilot in which you really don't know how

1455
00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:04.250
to program all you have to know

1456
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:06.740
is how to go about preparing the

1457
00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:09.230
material plug it in and pilot will

1458
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:11.210
organize the presentation for the

1459
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:13.580
students it's not really programming its

1460
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.650
organizing material but perhaps once

1461
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:18.320
again pilot often causes teachers to

1462
00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.630
force the information into too tight a

1463
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:22.640
channel now we'll talk about games and

1464
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.140
simulations and other things that are

1465
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.030
very good in the learning environment in

1466
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:27.470
a moment but what I'd like to talk about

1467
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:31.160
now is that it's probably always best if

1468
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.590
the student has a large range of options

1469
00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:35.810
if the student is simply being forced to

1470
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:38.810
put in simple canned replies there's

1471
00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:40.640
less interest in there and perhaps

1472
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.170
there's less excitement pants you're

1473
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:44.060
throwing away some of the good things

1474
00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.160
the students bring let me see if I can

1475
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.140
show you a simple drill program which is

1476
00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:51.260
organized so that it allows the student

1477
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:54.400
to exercise certain options as desired

1478
00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.980
this is a simple example of an addition

1479
00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:02.300
program we'll say run and the program

1480
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.580
says this is a simple addition four plus

1481
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:06.619
seven now here we're using the four

1482
01:00:06.619 --> 01:00:09.140
function keys on the right-hand side of

1483
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.089
the computer at the bottom of the screen

1484
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:12.950
they're identified the function one is

1485
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:15.080
called a help key if you don't know the

1486
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.390
answer you press that key the question

1487
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:19.609
here is four plus seven if we press the

1488
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:23.089
f1 key the answer 11 will appear on the

1489
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:25.130
screen and now a new program is set in

1490
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:28.910
there anytime we want to try our hand at

1491
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:30.890
doing it eight plus six well perhaps

1492
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:34.190
that's 14 we can type in the answer and

1493
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.500
we're identified yes it's correct seven

1494
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.599
and three we're trying nine no that's

1495
01:00:38.599 --> 01:00:39.830
wrong on the border of the screen

1496
01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:41.570
changes color for the moment so we can

1497
01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:43.700
see visibly that something's happening

1498
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.740
here we could also have sounds to give

1499
01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.570
us an audible signal that something is

1500
01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:51.050
wrong here now that's one of the things

1501
01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:52.790
that we can do we can ask the computer

1502
01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:54.470
for the answer anytime we're still

1503
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:56.089
trying to learn we still really don't

1504
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:57.530
know how to do this sort of thing

1505
01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:00.830
eventually we can try filling in these

1506
01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:02.359
things and when we get enough right

1507
01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:04.490
answer we may say hey we're ready for a

1508
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:07.130
test when we enter the test mode which

1509
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.920
is a key f7 down here then we're going

1510
01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.770
to be marked on what we put in now the

1511
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:14.540
point that's being emphasized here is

1512
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.140
that the student doesn't have a sense

1513
01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.720
a single path if the student doesn't

1514
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.900
want to answer he or she doesn't have to

1515
01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.210
the student can simply say help and get

1516
01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:26.610
the correct answer this is the area

1517
01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:27.750
where they are when the student thinks

1518
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.720
he or she is ready then we can press key

1519
01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.750
f7 and go from exercise mode into the

1520
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.670
test there are 10 questions if we answer

1521
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:37.890
them correctly will be marked and they

1522
01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.450
teach you will be able to see 6 plus 5

1523
01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:42.390
is 11 that one is correct now we're at

1524
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:45.630
test number two 7 plus 7 is 14 that's

1525
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:47.910
also correct if at any time however the

1526
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:51.240
student feels that maybe it's not time

1527
01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.630
yet the test is premature we can always

1528
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:56.460
go back and we can always do more

1529
01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.910
exercises and take the test again later

1530
01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:01.500
that's the kind of interaction that's

1531
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.270
probably good and this is a very simple

1532
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:06.180
one but the student is in control the

1533
01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.280
student can say I want to do more

1534
01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:08.790
practice

1535
01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:11.700
I want to do less I'm ready to qualify

1536
01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.580
myself and say hey I'm ready but the

1537
01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.470
more options we give people the more

1538
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:18.270
creative a person feels on that kind of

1539
01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:20.100
machine and very often

1540
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.640
creativity is what it's all about that's

1541
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:24.870
all I want to say about the general

1542
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:26.400
principles of computer assisted

1543
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.130
instructions next time we'll discuss

1544
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:33.170
computers talking to computers

1545
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:36.410
Computers talking to computers

1546
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:43.360
[Music]

1547
01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.820
the computer seems to be an isolated

1548
01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.700
little device but in fact by adding

1549
01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.860
equipment you can make your computer

1550
01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:53.380
talk to the world there are some

1551
01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.500
technical problems to be solved here

1552
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.850
mostly you'll want to your computer to

1553
01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:00.640
communicate over telephone lines and

1554
01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.630
telephone lines were designed for speech

1555
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:06.280
computers that want to talk to other

1556
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.770
computers can't use speech even if they

1557
01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:10.960
could talk the computer at the other end

1558
01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.960
would have trouble listening to speech

1559
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.700
instead we have to convert the bits that

1560
01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.790
are inside the computer into frequencies

1561
01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:21.280
that can be passed over the telephone

1562
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.500
line and then we have to change the

1563
01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.000
frequencies through the telephone line

1564
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.400
back into the bits of the computer at

1565
01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.030
the other end will accept changing the

1566
01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:32.530
bits in a computer the frequencies is

1567
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:35.800
called modulation and a device that a

1568
01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.230
modulator now when we get to the other

1569
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:40.450
end the frequencies have to be changed

1570
01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.880
back to bits and that's called

1571
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.670
demodulation we do it with a demodulator

1572
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:47.350
and then communication is a two-way

1573
01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:50.880
street so at either end we have a

1574
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.700
modulator sending the signal and for the

1575
01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.620
other paths coming back to you there's a

1576
01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.540
demodulator doing the whole thing this

1577
01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.370
results in a machine which does both

1578
01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.200
it's both the modulator and demodulator

1579
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.170
and so we call it by the rather peculiar

1580
01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:10.120
combination name of modem we need one of

1581
01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.670
those here for example is a commercial

1582
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:14.770
modem this one plugs into the

1583
01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:17.230
communications interface on the back of

1584
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:20.100
the computer we can plug it in back here

1585
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:24.970
at the rear of our Commodore 64 but

1586
01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:26.950
that's not quite enough the telephone

1587
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.870
line by the way plugs in to the little

1588
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:31.600
hole over here ok but that isn't enough

1589
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.060
to do the job this is just a piece of

1590
01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.820
hardware and it doesn't know how to get

1591
01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.610
the bits on the line it'll ship them

1592
01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.590
there when we deliver it but in order to

1593
01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:43.090
make the modem work we have to have a

1594
01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:45.640
program to go with it and if you buy a

1595
01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.310
modem for communications purposes you

1596
01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:50.380
should make sure that you also get a

1597
01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.480
compatible program to help you talk to

1598
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.310
computers at the other end

1599
01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.810
let's talk a little bit about what goes

1600
01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:00.130
over the telephone we know that it's

1601
01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:03.520
frequencies so that the telephone can be

1602
01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.100
used in its normal manner but there's

1603
01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.020
something else going on a special code

1604
01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.300
is used for communication not quite the

1605
01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.830
same as the code that's inside the

1606
01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:12.460
machine

1607
01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:15.850
it's called ASCII ASC III which stands

1608
01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.280
for the American Standard Code for

1609
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.700
information interchange and it's a good

1610
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.620
thing because even different mix of

1611
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.350
computers can talk to each other that

1612
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:29.380
way now let's assume that you've

1613
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.290
connected up a modem and you're ready to

1614
01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:33.970
talk to the world who are you going to

1615
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:35.650
talk to well there are several different

1616
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.260
places let's try to itemize it first of

1617
01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:41.350
all in many towns and communities there

1618
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:44.050
are computer bulletin boards there are

1619
01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.960
computers that will receive your call

1620
01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.460
except the messages from you store them

1621
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.980
away and deliver these message to other

1622
01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.750
people who called in it's a little bit

1623
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.510
like a bulletin board in your home you

1624
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.630
can hang up notices saying for sale one

1625
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:00.790
computer going cheap or whatever your

1626
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.620
particular communication happens to be

1627
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.240
and other people will read that and

1628
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.190
perhaps answer you you'll have to call

1629
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:09.340
in again to get the answer what kind of

1630
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.200
a price do you pay to use a bulletin

1631
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.750
board they're usually free they're

1632
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:15.970
usually done by individuals in your

1633
01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:18.820
community or neighborhood in the evening

1634
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.110
when they're not using the computer for

1635
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.000
anything else they hook it on to their

1636
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.420
telephone line and use it that way what

1637
01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.640
else can you use a computer for in the

1638
01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.050
communications world well you can call

1639
01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:32.740
into databases large computers that

1640
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:36.280
handle a great deal of information there

1641
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.050
are many commercial databases around

1642
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:40.650
such as for example the source

1643
01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:45.070
CompuServe and several others they not

1644
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.620
only store information but they are in

1645
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:50.260
and of themselves very large computers

1646
01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.060
and they can also do large-scale

1647
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.310
computing in case you find something

1648
01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.470
that Commodore 64 is a little too small

1649
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:59.800
for or a little too slow for so you can

1650
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.870
tap the resources of bigger computers

1651
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:04.120
and you can tap their information to

1652
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.250
perhaps stock reports perhaps other

1653
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.050
things here we have a computer that we

1654
01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:08.380
use

1655
01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:12.789
for several things for example we

1656
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:14.829
contacted CompuServe and on there we

1657
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:17.559
have the CBM club that's on Commodore

1658
01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:20.589
Business Machines it tells you news and

1659
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:23.559
information from Commodore on the new

1660
01:07:23.559 --> 01:07:24.700
products and things that have been

1661
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.980
happening you might have new information

1662
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.250
on the 64 from there what else can we do

1663
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:32.799
well over on the printer we have the

1664
01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:35.170
shop at home feature we can actually

1665
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:37.630
look around and look at products that we

1666
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:39.759
can obtain it's a little bit like a

1667
01:07:39.759 --> 01:07:42.819
mail-order catalog another thing we have

1668
01:07:42.819 --> 01:07:44.650
on the screen right now we've

1669
01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:47.529
interrogated the computer and said what

1670
01:07:47.529 --> 01:07:50.170
slights do you have going from Denver

1671
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:53.710
Colorado to London England turns out

1672
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.240
that the computers searched it's got

1673
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.829
memory and look for all of the

1674
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:58.599
connections and what we have here are

1675
01:07:58.599 --> 01:08:01.720
for example one direct flight that takes

1676
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.200
place at about 8:15 p.m. and we have two

1677
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.019
flights involving connection one of them

1678
01:08:08.019 --> 01:08:09.819
that looks like it goes through Boston

1679
01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:11.650
and the other one goes through Denver

1680
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.599
I'm sorry through Salt Lake City we

1681
01:08:13.599 --> 01:08:16.120
started at Denver didn't we that's the

1682
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.190
way we can sort out information it can

1683
01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:21.040
be right up to the minute it can be very

1684
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.469
very informative if you want to evaluate

1685
01:08:23.469 --> 01:08:25.989
your stocks if you want to read perhaps

1686
01:08:25.989 --> 01:08:28.060
the latest sports information if you

1687
01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.520
want to be trained on something lungs or

1688
01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.679
something you can do that because but

1689
01:08:32.679 --> 01:08:34.690
when you put a communications port on

1690
01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:37.540
your computer your computer is no longer

1691
01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:40.389
alone when you go to use your computer

1692
01:08:40.389 --> 01:08:43.299
you can share information with the

1693
01:08:43.299 --> 01:08:45.730
entire world and that's a very good

1694
01:08:45.730 --> 01:08:47.200
thing to be able to do

1695
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.439
[Music]

1696
01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:58.450
Commodore 64 language

1697
01:09:00.799 --> 01:09:03.170
many people are confused by computer

1698
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:06.140
languages you don't need to be computer

1699
01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.210
languages are just the ways that we

1700
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:11.000
write programs for the computer and in

1701
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.549
fact as a beginner you'll use the

1702
01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:16.460
languages that come with a machine we'll

1703
01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.620
talk about other languages later but

1704
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.210
first I'd like to make an important

1705
01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:23.210
distinction computer languages

1706
01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.450
themselves are the commands that you use

1707
01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:27.890
to write a program that will work for

1708
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:30.109
you but there's another part of the

1709
01:09:30.109 --> 01:09:32.359
computer that's related to a computer

1710
01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:34.310
language that we often don't think of

1711
01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:36.410
and that's called a computer operating

1712
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:38.920
system sometimes a computer monitor and

1713
01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.380
what that does is that one is the part

1714
01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:43.910
of the computer that lets you talk to

1715
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:46.069
the computer that makes a connection

1716
01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:48.290
between all the pieces when I tap on

1717
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.180
that keyboard and the results appear on

1718
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.830
the screen that's not happening

1719
01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:53.990
automatically that's a computer

1720
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.600
operating system doing it for us now we

1721
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.060
usually assume that that's there but the

1722
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:01.820
difficulty is this that one of these

1723
01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.860
days you may switch over to a rather

1724
01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.380
different kind of monitor or operating

1725
01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.780
system and then it comes as a shock if

1726
01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.180
you don't realize that the computer the

1727
01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.380
way it speaks to you and the way you

1728
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:15.440
speak to it is part of a programming

1729
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.830
system and it can be changed now we'll

1730
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:20.570
talk a bit about the computer languages

1731
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:21.890
that come in the machine we've seen

1732
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:24.980
basic already and we'll be taking more

1733
01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.960
looks at basic in the future basic as a

1734
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.180
nice simple language basic stance for

1735
01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.650
all-purpose symbolic instruction code

1736
01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.500
and it's quite an easy language for

1737
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.880
beginners to gain their first

1738
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.940
familiarity with a computer very likely

1739
01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.650
you'll be dealing in basic because it's

1740
01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:44.630
there when you turn the machine on it

1741
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:48.260
says 38 thousand and change bytes basic

1742
01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:51.020
bytes free it's part of the system so

1743
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.580
this one comes with a system but there's

1744
01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.960
something important I'd like to mention

1745
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.480
about basic in a moment it can be

1746
01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.410
changed basic comes in a ROM chip a

1747
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:01.850
read-only memory chip and you think

1748
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:04.460
perhaps it's frozen forever carved in

1749
01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.730
stone written in silicon if you like but

1750
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:10.610
in fact it's possible to flip that chip

1751
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:12.070
away and

1752
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:14.350
in its place a different version of

1753
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:16.090
basic or for that matter any other

1754
01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:18.490
language you choose we'll come back to

1755
01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:19.840
that in a moment but I'd like to mention

1756
01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.250
something else there's another built-in

1757
01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:23.770
language in this computer it's a one

1758
01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:25.150
that really does all the work

1759
01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:28.090
it's called machine language and it's

1760
01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:30.970
how the machine itself works now the

1761
01:11:30.970 --> 01:11:33.340
visible thing about machine language is

1762
01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:36.370
that because it's right inside the

1763
01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:38.230
circuitry of the machine it runs very

1764
01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:42.250
very quickly it's fast probably that's

1765
01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:43.830
the cosmetic part of machine language

1766
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:46.510
the important part of machine language

1767
01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:50.590
is that once you get into it you'll get

1768
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:52.240
a better understanding of the insides of

1769
01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.060
the machine because everything works by

1770
01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.400
machine language making it happen even

1771
01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.100
basic is machine language doing all the

1772
01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.100
work for the basic language I'd like to

1773
01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.810
demonstrate to you just a little bit of

1774
01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:06.160
machine language so that you can

1775
01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.580
appreciate its dazzling speed if I go

1776
01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.050
over to the computer now it seems to

1777
01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:13.540
have a blank screen I can touch keys and

1778
01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.340
by touching a key suddenly the screen

1779
01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:19.630
fills with characters so accordingly if

1780
01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:22.480
I touch more keys we can get a different

1781
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.610
set of characters appearing in the

1782
01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:27.850
various parts of the screen now machine

1783
01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:30.430
language is fast basic couldn't possibly

1784
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:32.590
fill the screen with characters like

1785
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:35.140
that ok we can see that we have

1786
01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.300
something working here that's many times

1787
01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:41.700
maybe dozens of times faster than basic

1788
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.930
let's talk a little bit more about

1789
01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:45.940
machine language we certainly aren't

1790
01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:47.410
going to show you how to program it now

1791
01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:49.960
it's not fundamentally difficult but the

1792
01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.040
thing that you have to keep in mind

1793
01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.350
about machine language it's a new sort

1794
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:55.180
of discipline and it's a little more

1795
01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:57.010
mechanical than the basic we use it's

1796
01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:59.080
not quite as helpful to us but for the

1797
01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.510
moment let's switch into a communication

1798
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:04.570
device called a machine language monitor

1799
01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:07.960
and here we see a series of

1800
01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.390
hieroglyphics and now we're no longer

1801
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.580
talking to basic this is what we call

1802
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:15.040
the operating system on monitor we're

1803
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.190
talking to the insides of the machine if

1804
01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:20.080
I want to display memory I don't say

1805
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.270
peak anymore if I want to print

1806
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:23.920
something I don't say print anymore I

1807
01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.420
must know the

1808
01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.850
communications language that I have to

1809
01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:30.640
use here I suddenly have lost all of my

1810
01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.980
usual basic communications out there was

1811
01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:39.130
simple memory display that happens to be

1812
01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:40.989
our program but unless you've had quite

1813
01:13:40.989 --> 01:13:42.429
a bit of practice you're really gonna

1814
01:13:42.429 --> 01:13:45.790
have a lot of trouble reading it doesn't

1815
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:46.210
matter

1816
01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:48.250
we'll return back to basic basics as

1817
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:50.199
ready and this looks much more familiar

1818
01:13:50.199 --> 01:13:52.270
remember machine language is in there if

1819
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:53.920
you see the machine doing something with

1820
01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.260
dazzling speed is probably the built in

1821
01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.630
machine language doing it now I'd like

1822
01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:00.360
to show you something rather different

1823
01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.969
this is basic and of course if I type

1824
01:14:02.969 --> 01:14:09.040
print 100 plus 22 it prints the answer

1825
01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.350
122 that's a basic that we've grown to

1826
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:14.260
know a little bit it's not difficult but

1827
01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.570
as I said before you can make your own

1828
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:18.730
basic without having to bring in

1829
01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:20.800
anything from the outside without having

1830
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.000
to plug anything into the back of the

1831
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.460
machine we can flip the old basic away

1832
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.590
and bring it a different basic I've

1833
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:28.960
prepared a very slightly different

1834
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.770
version of basic in the machine and if I

1835
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:35.590
flip away the standard basic my basic

1836
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:37.120
which is already stored in this machine

1837
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.949
will come to the floor let me change

1838
01:14:38.949 --> 01:14:42.219
that with a simple poke I'm going to

1839
01:14:42.219 --> 01:14:45.910
type 1 comma 54 but don't you do this

1840
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:48.429
unless you also have prepared a basic in

1841
01:14:48.429 --> 01:14:50.739
memory because otherwise the regular

1842
01:14:50.739 --> 01:14:52.690
basic goes away and you don't have any

1843
01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:55.810
language left I'll say poke 154 the new

1844
01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:58.600
basic is working and one of the few

1845
01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.219
things that I've done to this machine is

1846
01:15:00.219 --> 01:15:02.790
to say instead of saying ready say hello

1847
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:06.150
so this basic I can say print as before

1848
01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:09.850
100 plus 22 and it will do so but when

1849
01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:11.440
it's finished it says hallo instead of

1850
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.170
ready a very small difference I've had

1851
01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:15.580
one other if I put in the line that

1852
01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:19.030
means nonsense we know that the standard

1853
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:22.030
machine says syntax error for something

1854
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:24.160
makes no sense at all I've gone into

1855
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.679
basic and I change that message and so

1856
01:15:26.679 --> 01:15:28.510
my basic says something slightly

1857
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:30.130
different when I press return

1858
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:33.460
it says idiot error though these are

1859
01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.350
small on cosmetic changes but you do

1860
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:37.510
have the capability of making major

1861
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:38.440
changes to

1862
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.540
basic language if you want to you're not

1863
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:42.820
fixed with any single kind of basic or

1864
01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:44.739
any single kind of language and in fact

1865
01:15:44.739 --> 01:15:46.120
if you have something in the computer

1866
01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.640
like a word processor or other large

1867
01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.590
thing you don't need basic tongue you

1868
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:52.840
can move it right out and use that

1869
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.449
memory space for whatever else you'd

1870
01:15:55.449 --> 01:15:57.940
like to use it for we'll talk in a

1871
01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.250
moment about the extra languages that

1872
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:03.570
can be added to the computer

1873
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:16.470
we've talked about the languages that

1874
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:18.600
are built into your Commodore 64

1875
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.970
microcomputer but there were languages

1876
01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:22.590
you can also add to the microcomputer

1877
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:25.200
that are not built in already I'd like

1878
01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.180
to talk about a few of them first of all

1879
01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.530
I'd like to talk about something that is

1880
01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:30.480
really not a computer language it's an

1881
01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.930
operating system that's CPM it stands

1882
01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:37.340
for control program microprocessor and

1883
01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.020
it's an operating system that is it's

1884
01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.570
not a language to write programs in it's

1885
01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:45.180
a way to communicate with a computer to

1886
01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.560
make it work quite different from the

1887
01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.900
one that you've seen before

1888
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:51.450
now let's take a look at a CPM system we

1889
01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:53.550
have one built into the computer here

1890
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:57.300
now it's similar to programming systems

1891
01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.400
used on other large microprocessor

1892
01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.380
computers and therefore there may be

1893
01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:03.240
programs you can buy which fit on these

1894
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.250
other computers that will also work on

1895
01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:09.090
the Commodore CPM system it's a transfer

1896
01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.100
ability of program type of system

1897
01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.960
there's a lot of computers which use CPM

1898
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.820
let's take a look at what we have here

1899
01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:20.340
now we have a CPM system there's quite a

1900
01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.050
different message on the screen that

1901
01:17:22.050 --> 01:17:26.490
says Commodore 64 44 K CPM system and it

1902
01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:28.410
has to copyright statements on it but

1903
01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:30.660
the interesting thing is you can tell

1904
01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:32.400
it's not basic because it doesn't say

1905
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.560
ready

1906
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.940
instead what difference is a capital

1907
01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.640
letter a followed by a greater than sign

1908
01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.130
it looks a bit like an arrow and what

1909
01:17:41.130 --> 01:17:42.240
you find is that all of the

1910
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.980
communications we've learned for basic

1911
01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.680
don't work on this system in other words

1912
01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.960
if I say print or catalog or save none

1913
01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.000
of them work because CPM has its own

1914
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.500
language in its own way of doing things

1915
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.810
for example if I want to see what's on

1916
01:17:57.810 --> 01:18:02.190
the disk I might say D IR for directory

1917
01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:05.670
that's what I have to type in dir not

1918
01:18:05.670 --> 01:18:09.540
catalog I'm doing this and now a CPM

1919
01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.070
directory which looks quite a bit

1920
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:12.930
different from a basic directory is

1921
01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:15.540
appearing on the screen we won't go

1922
01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.370
through any of these programs or

1923
01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:19.800
indicate what they do at the moment but

1924
01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.820
the sort of thing that's interesting

1925
01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:24.210
here is that when we want a program we

1926
01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:26.760
often don't say load

1927
01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.489
the program will come in but we have to

1928
01:18:29.489 --> 01:18:32.130
just give its name for example there's a

1929
01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:34.020
program in there to help look for bugs

1930
01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:35.880
look for errors in programming it's

1931
01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.780
called dynamic debugging tool because

1932
01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.160
it's there to get rid of bugs we

1933
01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:44.550
abbreviate it what else DDT to bring it

1934
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:47.070
in all we do is type its name DDT

1935
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:51.210
press return and the program starts to

1936
01:18:51.210 --> 01:18:54.270
come in here there will take a few

1937
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:56.100
moments for the program to come in but

1938
01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.290
when it does we'll find once again we're

1939
01:18:58.290 --> 01:19:00.120
still working in something of a foreign

1940
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:04.110
language with a computer DDT it doesn't

1941
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:05.820
work like regular programs and we'll

1942
01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:07.230
find that the screen doesn't behave like

1943
01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:09.660
regular programs it's in now if I want

1944
01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.340
to look at the registers in the computer

1945
01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:13.710
I can type X and return and we get a

1946
01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:15.270
printout that's showing is there but

1947
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:16.800
it's not our purpose here to show in

1948
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.440
detail how to use CPM simply that we

1949
01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.700
have a totally different line of

1950
01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.010
communications from computer into the

1951
01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:24.930
system when we have a different

1952
01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:28.500
operating system like CPM in place let's

1953
01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.110
take DDT out with using a control C

1954
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:33.380
command which is quite standard in CPM

1955
01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:36.000
cp/m operating system itself will come

1956
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.130
back in and the system will take over

1957
01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:41.070
again let me emphasize you don't have

1958
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:43.320
basic if you want basic you'd have to

1959
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.710
bring one in from disk there might be

1960
01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:49.950
several basics you can get with CPM you

1961
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:51.600
might bring in other languages are not

1962
01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.010
basic pilot or logo or Pascal or COBOL

1963
01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:58.800
or Fortran there's plenty of them but in

1964
01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.110
they come and now we're back to CPM and

1965
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:03.239
we once again have our a and greater

1966
01:20:03.239 --> 01:20:05.850
than sign the prompt saying CPM wants

1967
01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:08.100
our next command now let's not continue

1968
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.470
with CPM it's a rather a specialized

1969
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:12.480
field but instead I'd like to show you

1970
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.989
what makes up CPM this is a rather big

1971
01:20:15.989 --> 01:20:18.600
box that we plug into the computer to

1972
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.840
make CPM work in fact it's this big

1973
01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.610
because it contains an entire computer

1974
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.310
system of its own there's an extra

1975
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:29.280
processor in here to make CPM do the

1976
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.070
things that it does that's why it's

1977
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:33.930
rather large rather complex but that of

1978
01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:36.469
course is the key to its compatibility

1979
01:20:36.469 --> 01:20:38.230
CPM

1980
01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:40.300
has the same processor chip as many

1981
01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.370
other computers and therefore it will

1982
01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:47.050
work the same okay that's probably all

1983
01:20:47.050 --> 01:20:48.820
we need to say about operating systems

1984
01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.489
at the moment let's talk about a few

1985
01:20:51.489 --> 01:20:54.430
other computer languages logo is a

1986
01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:56.290
language which has been getting a good

1987
01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:59.620
deal of attention in education the most

1988
01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.690
visible part of logo is that it's a

1989
01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.970
turtle language which can be explained

1990
01:21:03.970 --> 01:21:06.790
this way it's as if we have a little

1991
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:09.489
controllable device rolling around on

1992
01:21:09.489 --> 01:21:11.739
the screen and when we say go forward

1993
01:21:11.739 --> 01:21:14.230
ten paces it moves that distance when we

1994
01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:16.650
say turn right it turns right and so on

1995
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:20.350
this is often used for younger children

1996
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:22.480
in the school environment to learn the

1997
01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.040
rules of logic law was a very

1998
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.300
interesting language but let's do a

1999
01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:27.540
couple of simple turtle things first

2000
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:34.270
we'll say forward 50 and as soon as we

2001
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:36.160
do so and as soon as I press return the

2002
01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.020
turtle will appear it will move forward

2003
01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:39.970
50 there it is you can see it's moved up

2004
01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:41.890
the turtle is a little white triangle

2005
01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:44.530
near the top now I'll say well let's

2006
01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:48.400
turn right let's say a hundred and

2007
01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.220
thirty five and we can see that it's

2008
01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.680
turned around now if I say forward fifty

2009
01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:56.680
again we can see that the turtle has now

2010
01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.530
moved through an angle now with these

2011
01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:02.200
sort of commands move forward turn left

2012
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.600
turn right move a certain distance we

2013
01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.400
can do some very pretty things on the

2014
01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.630
screen in particular if we want to we

2015
01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:14.080
can build pre-written routines to do

2016
01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.630
certain things for example if I say to

2017
01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:19.390
the computer whoops if I must spell it

2018
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:22.810
correctly however triangle the computer

2019
01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:24.489
will draw a triangle on this prodigal

2020
01:22:24.489 --> 01:22:26.410
move forward the right distance turn to

2021
01:22:26.410 --> 01:22:28.210
the right angle and do several other

2022
01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:31.150
things the definition of a triangle is

2023
01:22:31.150 --> 01:22:32.590
involved in this case with the

2024
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:34.780
definition of a number of angles but we

2025
01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:37.810
have we can see that definition if we

2026
01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:40.420
want to but the important thing is that

2027
01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:43.030
if we have something called triangle we

2028
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:44.739
can call it several times let me call

2029
01:22:44.739 --> 01:22:45.779
triangle

2030
01:22:45.779 --> 01:22:48.509
and there's a triangle let me call it

2031
01:22:48.509 --> 01:22:51.419
again the turtle has moved slightly if I

2032
01:22:51.419 --> 01:22:53.009
call it again it will draw a triangle in

2033
01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:55.729
a slightly offset position and again

2034
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:58.469
triangle and you can see we're starting

2035
01:22:58.469 --> 01:23:00.569
to build a sort of pattern this is a

2036
01:23:00.569 --> 01:23:02.339
sort of thing that can be very enriching

2037
01:23:02.339 --> 01:23:04.709
for younger children they can work

2038
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:06.269
around with various sort of diagrams

2039
01:23:06.269 --> 01:23:08.159
will complete this triangle which I

2040
01:23:08.159 --> 01:23:10.349
think we call a star and here we go

2041
01:23:10.349 --> 01:23:12.119
drawing a series of triangle so they

2042
01:23:12.119 --> 01:23:14.489
come together like a fan of will or a

2043
01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:19.399
sort of very highly multi pointed star

2044
01:23:20.890 --> 01:23:23.290
there it is we could also draw other

2045
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:25.750
figures for example we have one composed

2046
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:29.220
of a number of circles if we say circle

2047
01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:32.140
there is a circle being drawn from the

2048
01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.690
turtle starting point if we want to draw

2049
01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:37.720
a series of circles we could ask for say

2050
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.780
a flower which is a series of interval

2051
01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:43.030
there goes a first circle the turtle

2052
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:45.160
will shift and draw another one and you

2053
01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.750
can see that something which is rather

2054
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:50.070
flower like is being drawn on the screen

2055
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:52.360
now these are all very nice but what's

2056
01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.860
the point of it well first of all it

2057
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.830
teaches children the ideas behind logic

2058
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:59.590
the whole idea be behind describing a

2059
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:01.630
flower in what we might call a

2060
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:03.640
subroutine of the computer and they're

2061
01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.550
just calling it up by saying its name

2062
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:08.260
teaches something about building logic

2063
01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:10.750
and building it in a module it's there

2064
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.820
to be used and then we can build many

2065
01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.160
flowers we might build a flower bed by

2066
01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.770
calling the command flower many times in

2067
01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:20.500
different situations it's in a way a

2068
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:24.460
logic trainer there are other turtle

2069
01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.560
programs such as for example the turtle

2070
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.950
graphics package turned out be h es logo

2071
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:32.110
is particularly an interesting language

2072
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:35.280
in that it's based on a much older

2073
01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.010
language called Lisp Lisp stands for a

2074
01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:41.500
list of processing language and it's the

2075
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.530
language of how things interrelate Lisp

2076
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:46.060
is traditionally the language of

2077
01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.280
artificial intelligence that's the whole

2078
01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.590
story in itself but what we really have

2079
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:53.380
here is a very sound language with some

2080
01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:56.110
very interesting trimmings on it mostly

2081
01:24:56.110 --> 01:24:59.950
used in education let's touch this talk

2082
01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:01.900
for a moment about some of the other

2083
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.910
languages that you can get for the

2084
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:06.850
Commodore 64 we can get some CPM as we

2085
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:08.560
mentioned before and there are also

2086
01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.110
languages such as Pascal which is a very

2087
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:18.040
formalized computer language pilot which

2088
01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:20.380
is an authoring language for educators

2089
01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.720
as we've mentioned before we've talked

2090
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.310
about logo there's a new language from

2091
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:28.000
Denmark called Como which combines the

2092
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.550
ease of basic with the power of a

2093
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:32.440
language like Pascal and there are many

2094
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.409
many others why

2095
01:25:33.409 --> 01:25:35.059
you pick another language beside basic

2096
01:25:35.059 --> 01:25:37.400
largely because you have a certain job

2097
01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.099
to do and other languages are better

2098
01:25:40.099 --> 01:25:43.039
suited for the job that you're after so

2099
01:25:43.039 --> 01:25:45.409
most of us beginners the thing that we

2100
01:25:45.409 --> 01:25:47.959
need to know is that basic comes with

2101
01:25:47.959 --> 01:25:49.760
the basics probably a good way to start

2102
01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.800
there's always a powerful thing called

2103
01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.229
machine language on the inside but

2104
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:56.209
finally if you find that basic for some

2105
01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:58.489
reason doesn't measure up to a certain

2106
01:25:58.489 --> 01:26:00.769
job you have there are other languages

2107
01:26:00.769 --> 01:26:03.169
available you can take basic out you can

2108
01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:06.309
plug the new languages in

2109
01:26:13.449 --> 01:26:16.449
graphics

2110
01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.880
graphics is a very interesting

2111
01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.980
characteristic of the Commodore 64

2112
01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:26.330
you've seen some of the fine graphics

2113
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:28.550
that can be done with games what I'd

2114
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.130
like to talk about now is the techniques

2115
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:33.760
that are used to make graphics happen

2116
01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.680
mostly they're used in programs you

2117
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.090
won't need to do that unless you try

2118
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:40.250
your hand at programming but it's

2119
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:41.690
interesting to know how some of these

2120
01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:43.670
things are accomplished and some of them

2121
01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:46.940
are easier than you think let's talk

2122
01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.440
about the first kind of graphic and that

2123
01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.150
is you can draw pictures using ordinary

2124
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:52.330
characters letters of the alphabet

2125
01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:55.310
numbers and all of the special symbols

2126
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:58.460
that we find on the front keys there I'd

2127
01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.050
like to show a simple example of that

2128
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:04.100
here if I press a key I can cause a face

2129
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.740
to be drawn that faces to letter o Tzar

2130
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.170
letter V and an equal sign and we can

2131
01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:11.930
draw a border around that face if we use

2132
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:14.870
the special graphics which exist inside

2133
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:16.430
the Commodore we're just using the

2134
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:17.720
special things that are built in all

2135
01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.280
these characters are built-in and you

2136
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.410
can draw some quite fine pictures using

2137
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:24.500
the ones that are there but you can do

2138
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.200
it a better way if you need more detail

2139
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.030
if you need things that aren't available

2140
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:32.900
in the existing graphics easiest way of

2141
01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:35.420
doing it is this you can change the

2142
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.080
existing characters ABCDEF and the

2143
01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.170
special graphics and so on into a

2144
01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:46.910
special character set of your own I've

2145
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:49.280
programmed the computer so that now the

2146
01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.830
characters have been changed let's go

2147
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:55.340
and take a look at them I changed the

2148
01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:57.350
letter A in fact I changed this partly

2149
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:59.570
the Greek alphabet the letter A is now

2150
01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:01.960
the Greek Alpha character there it is

2151
01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:07.970
okay the letter B is the Greek beta and

2152
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:10.160
as you might suspect to let us see has

2153
01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.010
been changed to the character called

2154
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:19.130
gamma and letter D to a delta we could

2155
01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:20.600
have changed out the characters to the

2156
01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.030
entire Greek set or any other set you

2157
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:24.800
want if you want to write in Hebrew or

2158
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.650
Cyrillic or Arabic define your own

2159
01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:30.950
characters the 64 has the capability

2160
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:32.990
right within its software

2161
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:35.540
to do all of that well we can do other

2162
01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:38.000
things for example I defined another

2163
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.470
letter here into a rather curious

2164
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:42.140
character doesn't look like anything

2165
01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:43.820
looks like a bit of code let's take a

2166
01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.590
look at that and say why would we do

2167
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:47.780
that well perhaps you might be able to

2168
01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.730
guess if I show you a different

2169
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:52.040
character that I've defined now I select

2170
01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.780
out parts of the alphabet for this one

2171
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:57.800
too but here's what we have if I put all

2172
01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.140
of these characters together this one

2173
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:02.420
and then this one and then I'll go down

2174
01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.850
to the next line and put down this one

2175
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:08.030
and this one what do we have a smiley

2176
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.500
face

2177
01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.910
fairly large with a bit of detail on it

2178
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:13.010
because it's four characters put

2179
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:16.970
together now when I finished if you see

2180
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:19.100
the principal's here I'd like to ask the

2181
01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.350
computer to return to its normal

2182
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:23.870
alphabetic characters and you'll see

2183
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:25.480
these things displayed on the screen

2184
01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:28.400
return to their normal alphabet you'll

2185
01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.900
see which keys that I press to make it

2186
01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.040
happen here we go

2187
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.110
and there are the characters that I was

2188
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:34.820
really pressing to make those things

2189
01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:37.370
happen so principle number one use the

2190
01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:39.230
built-in character span if the built-in

2191
01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:42.220
ones aren't good enough build your own

2192
01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.060
principle number three is a whole

2193
01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:47.000
different thing the 64 has a remarkable

2194
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.480
feature called sprites now a sprite is

2195
01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.640
almost like something that has a life of

2196
01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.580
its own on the screen it moves around

2197
01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.540
independently and can be controlled

2198
01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:59.060
independently of everything else and so

2199
01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.980
it may pass in front of something and

2200
01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:02.900
the material it passes in front of will

2201
01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:05.030
reappear let me show you a couple of

2202
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:07.670
simple sprites like this we can see a

2203
01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:09.530
couple of balloons moving around on the

2204
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:12.170
screen and you can see in fact that the

2205
01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:13.760
yellow balloon is moving behind the

2206
01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:16.100
alphabetic characters and the white

2207
01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.680
balloon is moving ahead of them we can

2208
01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.600
make this sort of thing happen I'll stop

2209
01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.390
these sprites for a moment and show you

2210
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:25.190
another feature I'll simply stop the

2211
01:30:25.190 --> 01:30:28.580
program the thing about sprites is that

2212
01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.310
they are so independent on the screen

2213
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:32.690
that they seem to have completely a life

2214
01:30:32.690 --> 01:30:34.430
of their own it's almost as if somebody

2215
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:36.560
pasted them on top of the screen and

2216
01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.450
they have nothing to do I list part of

2217
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:39.860
the program that we've been running to

2218
01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:42.740
do these characters and you can see the

2219
01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.360
sprites simply aren't affected by that

2220
01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.610
they stay on the screen all by

2221
01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:49.520
themselves let's continue this program I

2222
01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.960
haven't finished yet the sprites will

2223
01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.389
continue moving okay and you can see

2224
01:30:53.389 --> 01:30:54.679
that they move around among the

2225
01:30:54.679 --> 01:30:55.909
characters and don't really have any

2226
01:30:55.909 --> 01:30:59.770
problems there and then we'll go back

2227
01:30:59.770 --> 01:31:02.060
and I want to look at one other feature

2228
01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:05.090
now we've talked about then the regular

2229
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:06.380
grant the regular characters and

2230
01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:09.080
graphics building your own adding

2231
01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.850
sprites and you can do all of these and

2232
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:13.400
then there's finally one more thing you

2233
01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:16.670
can use a truly high resolution to

2234
01:31:16.670 --> 01:31:19.340
manipulate any part of the screen you

2235
01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:21.920
want the smallest thing you can draw on

2236
01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:24.830
the screen is called a pixel P IX e L

2237
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:28.040
and a pixel is a very small thing you

2238
01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.110
can get hundreds of them across the

2239
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:32.179
screen and hundreds vertically so a

2240
01:31:32.179 --> 01:31:34.360
pixel is a very small dot on the screen

2241
01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.980
now if we can individually turn on and

2242
01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:39.350
off any pixel and perhaps choose its

2243
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:42.320
color to a limited extent then we can

2244
01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.210
draw some very detailed things pixels

2245
01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:46.550
can be used for for example drawing

2246
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:49.600
mathematical curves they can be used for

2247
01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.860
sketching using a light pen or a

2248
01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:53.989
graphics tablet and they can give you a

2249
01:31:53.989 --> 01:31:55.850
great deal of control let's take a look

2250
01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:58.310
at a simple math curve drawn using

2251
01:31:58.310 --> 01:32:01.070
pixels you can see that that logarithmic

2252
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:03.380
curve that we have on there is outlined

2253
01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:06.230
by turning on individual dots on the

2254
01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:09.710
screen that's pretty good that's pretty

2255
01:32:09.710 --> 01:32:10.659
impressive

2256
01:32:10.659 --> 01:32:13.760
that's probably the hardest way to do

2257
01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.949
things all of us not really hard but the

2258
01:32:15.949 --> 01:32:17.659
important thing for you to know is you

2259
01:32:17.659 --> 01:32:20.090
have a lot of options you have some very

2260
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:22.250
rich graphics available on the Commodore

2261
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:24.489
64

2262
01:32:28.499 --> 01:32:31.120
Commodore 64 working for you

2263
01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:36.910
[Music]

2264
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:39.130
here's a letter and I see from my notes

2265
01:32:39.130 --> 01:32:43.510
that everywhere I say vic-20 I should

2266
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:46.750
have said Commodore 64 let me call up

2267
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:49.210
that feature and say I want to change

2268
01:32:49.210 --> 01:32:56.400
and replace every place that says Vic 22

2269
01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:00.700
Commodore 64 it says more no that's all

2270
01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:02.890
I want to do and let's simply do it and

2271
01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:06.250
here we go and you can see that letter

2272
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:07.630
has now changed the three occurrences

2273
01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:10.360
it's all changed what else we need to do

2274
01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:13.020
well oh I'd say I've missed out a word

2275
01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:15.900
right after the word disc

2276
01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:19.360
I'd like to insert the word printer let

2277
01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.790
me go into insert mode and what you'll

2278
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:26.170
see is that when I type in that word all

2279
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:27.820
of the rest of the paragraph moves over

2280
01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:32.320
to make room pri nter see how easy it is

2281
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.660
another thing that I decided there's a

2282
01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:36.670
sentence down here I'd like to move

2283
01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:39.490
earlier in the whole operation so here's

2284
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:43.090
what I'll do I'll select a sentence

2285
01:33:43.090 --> 01:33:46.600
operation here and say I can pick up the

2286
01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.660
characters one by one here just a moment

2287
01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:51.700
there we go you can see that I'm picking

2288
01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.980
out part of the text and selecting it

2289
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.620
it's coming in and opposite font but I

2290
01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.060
can say give it a whole sentence there

2291
01:33:58.060 --> 01:33:59.680
it is in a couple more letters and

2292
01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.200
that's the part that I want now what do

2293
01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.030
I want to do with it I want to move it

2294
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:09.910
up here okay so what do I do I say use

2295
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:13.120
the Move command and here goes that

2296
01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.980
sentence it's moved up to the new place

2297
01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:17.560
you see it there now I'd better take it

2298
01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.970
out of the old place it's still there I

2299
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:21.160
just made a copy so I'll use the other

2300
01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.960
command and look down below you'll see

2301
01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.090
the sentence that I had disappearing

2302
01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:28.930
from the screen there it goes it's

2303
01:34:28.930 --> 01:34:31.150
pretty handy it's a very nice way to

2304
01:34:31.150 --> 01:34:32.500
rewrite a letter is there anything else

2305
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.350
I need to do I could move in the margins

2306
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:38.280
I suppose somewhere up near the top I

2307
01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.990
see this questions plural I want

2308
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:44.950
questions singular I'll take off the S

2309
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:48.020
let me just find the right place here

2310
01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.270
there's a letter s so simply delete it

2311
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:54.290
and that looks pretty good I'm ready to

2312
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:56.090
type the final draft of my letter here I

2313
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:58.360
go

2314
01:34:58.540 --> 01:34:59.870
whoops

2315
01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:08.180
not that way down let me erase that like

2316
01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:14.330
that and now we'll do it again and here

2317
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:16.870
comes my letter

2318
01:35:25.989 --> 01:35:28.370
I'll stop the letter now because we

2319
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:29.660
don't want to see the whole thing fit

2320
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:32.000
but let's talk about someone I've used

2321
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.370
the word processor the document that I

2322
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:37.820
composed is saved onto disk I can bring

2323
01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:39.020
it back into the computer's memory

2324
01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:41.630
change it change around complete words

2325
01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:44.300
and phrases substitute one word for the

2326
01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.250
other mr. Smith could become Miss Jones

2327
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:49.160
for example I can compose the letter and

2328
01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.630
I can make it very very good and when I

2329
01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:52.760
finished it'll come out word perfectly

2330
01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.310
this is called word processing and even

2331
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:57.170
now we're only showing a little bit of

2332
01:35:57.170 --> 01:35:59.719
its potential the particular one that

2333
01:35:59.719 --> 01:36:02.330
I'm showing here is called paperclip but

2334
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:04.160
there are many many word processors that

2335
01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.440
you can get commercially it's up to you

2336
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.690
to choose a one that has the style that

2337
01:36:08.690 --> 01:36:11.570
you want for example we have here many

2338
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:16.270
of them this Hesse Reiser Hess writer 64

2339
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:19.719
easy script

2340
01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:22.650
quick brown fox and there are others

2341
01:36:22.650 --> 01:36:24.450
that I still don't have here for

2342
01:36:24.450 --> 01:36:26.700
examples such as Word Pro and many

2343
01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:28.530
others there's quite a range of prices

2344
01:36:28.530 --> 01:36:30.600
quite a range of features what you have

2345
01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:34.130
to do is to choose the one you want

2346
01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:37.880
commodore 64 music

2347
01:36:43.219 --> 01:36:45.080
some good music can be played by the

2348
01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.410
Commodore 64 it has a built-in chip

2349
01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:50.750
which is called a sound interface device

2350
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:53.719
the s ID I think Commodore planned to

2351
01:36:53.719 --> 01:36:56.330
call up the sound interface chip until

2352
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:58.400
they thought of how it abbreviated then

2353
01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.260
they decided on sound at a face device

2354
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.090
now there's a lot of good things and

2355
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:03.590
you've heard some of the sound effects

2356
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:05.960
and music played during the games I'd

2357
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.190
like to show you how some of that

2358
01:37:07.190 --> 01:37:10.850
happens we won't talk about the special

2359
01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:13.040
sound effects those can be done by any

2360
01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.420
old ship I'd like to talk about music

2361
01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.430
that's what some of the quality of the

2362
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:20.180
six yet Rudi comes out the first thing

2363
01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:21.710
that we should talk about in music to

2364
01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:23.870
understand waveforms to understand how

2365
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:26.420
it works is wave once that's the basic

2366
01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:28.940
sound that any instrument produces it

2367
01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.949
might be mellow it might be sharp it

2368
01:37:30.949 --> 01:37:34.400
might be thin it might be brassy but

2369
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.730
every instrument has a certain waveform

2370
01:37:36.730 --> 01:37:39.590
now I've set up the computer so that

2371
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:41.330
we'll play the next few notes rather

2372
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:43.130
like an organ that is when I hold on a

2373
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:44.960
key they will play the note when I let

2374
01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.570
go it will stop immediately and so what

2375
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.250
we're going to do is concentrate on the

2376
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:51.290
waveforms we can hear the first waveform

2377
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:53.630
I have here is a triangular waveform

2378
01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:58.100
that's soft and mellow it's a sort of

2379
01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:00.680
sound you might hear from a flute let's

2380
01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.110
listen to the triangular waveform and

2381
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:06.580
hear its mellow sound

2382
01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:13.130
pretty good pretty soft right not all

2383
01:38:13.130 --> 01:38:14.780
instruments sound that mellow however

2384
01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.760
sometimes we want a little edge on them

2385
01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.480
sometimes we'd like to have a bit more

2386
01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:23.060
harmonics as musicians call it that case

2387
01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:24.980
we might choose another wave form called

2388
01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:27.680
a sawtooth waveform now a sawtooth wave

2389
01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.540
for him as you might suggest for the

2390
01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.660
name has a bit of an edge on the sound

2391
01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:35.540
it's much sharper and in some ways it's

2392
01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:39.820
much richer let's listen to a sawtooth

2393
01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:43.940
sounds quite different doesn't it and

2394
01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:44.930
yet that really isn't the whole

2395
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:47.390
combination of waveforms that we can use

2396
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:49.700
for instruments there are several others

2397
01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:52.640
in there too sometimes instument have a

2398
01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:55.550
rather thin and perhaps Reedy sound to

2399
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.940
them

2400
01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:59.510
that's called a pulse waveform there's

2401
01:38:59.510 --> 01:39:00.950
more than one kind of pulse wave

2402
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:02.990
waveform I'll play the thin one first

2403
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:05.480
we'll call that a pulse wave and you'll

2404
01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:07.580
hear what it sounds like it's a little

2405
01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:13.940
thin it's a little sharp listen okay no

2406
01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:15.980
more no mistaking that and yet sometimes

2407
01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:18.650
we want it finally the last kind of

2408
01:39:18.650 --> 01:39:21.200
pulse wave is a particular type called a

2409
01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:23.540
square wave that sounds rather rich a

2410
01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:26.120
bit brassy it sounds a little bit like

2411
01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:27.560
the sawtooth but not quite the same

2412
01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.690
let's listen to a square wave waveform

2413
01:39:32.710 --> 01:39:35.900
okay that's pretty good stuff now we've

2414
01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.730
listened to the basic wave form except

2415
01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:39.620
for noise which is used for drums and

2416
01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:42.620
gunshots and things like that but now

2417
01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:44.300
let's talk about something else apart

2418
01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:47.060
from the basic kind of thing that the

2419
01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:48.770
instrument sounds like it's basic wave

2420
01:39:48.770 --> 01:39:51.260
form there are other things that give

2421
01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:53.000
the instrument is characteristic sound

2422
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.940
and that's how quickly the sound starts

2423
01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:01.600
and how the sound stops we use the terms

2424
01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:05.060
adsr which stands for attack decay

2425
01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:08.390
sustain release to describe how the

2426
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:11.960
sound starts holds and stops when an

2427
01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.390
instrument is played in fact we call

2428
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:18.230
this the wave forms envelope but we

2429
01:40:18.230 --> 01:40:20.210
don't have to use this term if we know

2430
01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:21.830
what attack decay sustain will

2431
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:24.070
we'll be okay let's talk about those

2432
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:26.920
attack is how quickly the sound appears

2433
01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.000
if you have a percussion instrument

2434
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.830
something that you hit or strike or

2435
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:34.840
pluck the sound will start right away

2436
01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:38.540
then we have decay that's how quickly

2437
01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:41.380
the sound fades out out after its first

2438
01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:46.880
struck or begun some instruments don't

2439
01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:48.620
hold a sound for more than a moment some

2440
01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.910
hold it for quite a while before it

2441
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:52.130
settled down for example if you hit a

2442
01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:54.560
piano key you may notice that at the

2443
01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.180
moment that you strike that piano key

2444
01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.130
it's a little louder than they sound it

2445
01:40:58.130 --> 01:41:00.580
settles down a moment later

2446
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:04.340
that's the decay part now some

2447
01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:06.440
instruments will sustain and some ones

2448
01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:09.410
here's what we mean by sustain a piano

2449
01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:10.850
if you hold the key down the note

2450
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:14.240
continues to sound but on a guitar or

2451
01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:20.150
say a bass bass guitar after you strike

2452
01:41:20.150 --> 01:41:21.590
it the sound will fade away there's

2453
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:23.390
nothing you can do same thing as true

2454
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:25.550
say of a xylophone once you hit that

2455
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:27.590
note it has to fade away the only thing

2456
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:29.780
you do is hit it again and so we can't

2457
01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:32.150
sustain some instruments but others we

2458
01:41:32.150 --> 01:41:36.290
can for example if we want to we can

2459
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:38.630
hold down a piano key the sound will

2460
01:41:38.630 --> 01:41:41.570
sustain if we want to we can continue to

2461
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:43.850
blow into a trumpet or a mouth organ and

2462
01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:45.470
the sound will keep going as long as we

2463
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:47.030
don't run out of breaths

2464
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:48.710
and so these instrument have sustained

2465
01:41:48.710 --> 01:41:50.990
levels and we can state how long they

2466
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:52.370
will stay in there and finally we have

2467
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:54.920
release and that's how long it takes the

2468
01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:57.350
sound to go away after you let go of the

2469
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:59.090
key you may have noticed that when you

2470
01:41:59.090 --> 01:42:00.740
let go of a piano key it still sounds

2471
01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:02.270
for a moment afterwards when you start

2472
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:04.160
blowing into a trumpet there's usually a

2473
01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:06.950
little bit of sound left over let's use

2474
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:08.180
some of those principles on the

2475
01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:10.100
waveforms we've already listened to and

2476
01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:12.950
make certain kinds of instruments for

2477
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:15.080
example our first wave form is chime

2478
01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:18.800
like we'll use a soft mellow triangular

2479
01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:22.580
wave and we'll make it start immediately

2480
01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:24.260
when you hit a stripe chime it starts to

2481
01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.970
sound right away but then we'll take

2482
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:27.800
give the sound a long time to die away

2483
01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.290
we'll give it a long decay and release

2484
01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:31.370
here we go

2485
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:34.810
listen to the mellow chimes

2486
01:42:36.110 --> 01:42:40.020
okay recognize that mellow triangular

2487
01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:42.750
wave in there and yet we've changed it

2488
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:45.240
completely by adding an attack and a

2489
01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:49.200
fade away cycle to the whole thing now

2490
01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.940
sometimes we want to do exactly the same

2491
01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.740
kind of envelope attack very quickly and

2492
01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:55.590
fade away rather slowly but we don't

2493
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:58.080
want that mellow waveform if he struck a

2494
01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:01.950
guitar the waveform would be much

2495
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:04.770
sharper guitar has a sharper sound let's

2496
01:43:04.770 --> 01:43:07.260
take the sawtooth wave the one with an

2497
01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:09.810
edge and let's play that to exactly the

2498
01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:11.580
same attack sustain decay release

2499
01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.440
envelope and see what we have here's a

2500
01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.000
guitar listen to the difference

2501
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.840
[Music]

2502
01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:22.730
now that sounds pretty good perhaps

2503
01:43:22.730 --> 01:43:24.680
sometimes than some struck instrument we

2504
01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.930
don't want to hold it quite as long as

2505
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:29.630
we've shown here for example a banjo the

2506
01:43:29.630 --> 01:43:31.550
sound doesn't hold as a dozen a guitar

2507
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:34.730
it fades the Ray weather quickly and so

2508
01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:36.650
perhaps we could once again change to

2509
01:43:36.650 --> 01:43:37.220
the weather

2510
01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.470
thinner sound that a guitar would that a

2511
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:42.290
banjo would give us and say and let's

2512
01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:44.780
have a fairly fast release a fairly fast

2513
01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:47.420
decay on this one let's listen how the

2514
01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:49.520
sound would change we're going to the

2515
01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.820
pulse waveform and listening to a fairly

2516
01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:54.890
fast attack and a fairly fast decay and

2517
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:59.300
we'll use here we go once again it's

2518
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.250
different the envelope makes quite a

2519
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:03.680
difference finally all of the things

2520
01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.770
we've talked about so far have been fast

2521
01:44:06.770 --> 01:44:08.660
attack instruments that we strike

2522
01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.280
percussive things things that start to

2523
01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.410
sound right away other instruments take

2524
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:13.910
time for the sound to build up for

2525
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:16.430
example a trumpet a mouth organ or even

2526
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:18.410
when we're bowing a violin it takes time

2527
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:20.390
for the vibrations to reach full

2528
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:22.640
strengths on those we want a slower

2529
01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.360
attack and perhaps a medium medium sort

2530
01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.400
of sustain to hold the level as long as

2531
01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.530
we want to let's listen to the

2532
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:32.720
difference I've set up a square wave for

2533
01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.370
the bold brassy sound of a trumpet and

2534
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:37.160
it's at a moderately slow attack listen

2535
01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.080
to how the sound comes in and a

2536
01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:41.150
moderately faster Kate listen to it fade

2537
01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:44.110
away here's a trumpet

2538
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:48.680
you hear the difference that's the way

2539
01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:50.780
that we can put forth the basic waveform

2540
01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:55.310
which gives us our music quality soft or

2541
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:58.870
rich or mellow together with our

2542
01:44:58.870 --> 01:45:01.970
envelope which tells us how quickly the

2543
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:03.410
sound appears and dissapears to give

2544
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:05.750
ourselves a real musical thing now we've

2545
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:07.430
been playing three notes but we'd be

2546
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:08.540
playing them all with the same

2547
01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:11.330
instrumentation let's play a little tune

2548
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:16.070
here okay let's play a little tune here

2549
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:18.110
which uses three different instruments a

2550
01:45:18.110 --> 01:45:21.080
bell like or chime like instrument to

2551
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.850
carry the melody something sounding like

2552
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:24.920
more like a mouth organ to carry the

2553
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.300
second piece and down on the bass

2554
01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:28.700
there's probably a big bass guitar or

2555
01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.650
something that sounds like that let's

2556
01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:33.140
listen to a little music here

2557
01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:45.880
[Music]

2558
01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:52.120
I've been asked by the television taping

2559
01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:54.160
staff not to dance along with the music

2560
01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:57.780
so I think I'll have to sit this one out

2561
01:46:00.339 --> 01:46:02.380
computer games and simulations

2562

2564
01:46:24.349 --> 01:46:28.889
games were a lot of fun sometimes I

2565
01:46:28.889 --> 01:46:31.199
think the word game is stuck on almost

2566
01:46:31.199 --> 01:46:34.229
everything that isn't serious if you

2567
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:36.479
play music if you draw pictures with a

2568
01:46:36.479 --> 01:46:39.030
computer that's not a game you don't get

2569
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:41.339
a score but we call it games and that's

2570
01:46:41.339 --> 01:46:43.289
sometimes this down thing don't play

2571
01:46:43.289 --> 01:46:44.909
games don't play around on the computer

2572
01:46:44.909 --> 01:46:46.499
and yet there's a lot of good can come

2573
01:46:46.499 --> 01:46:50.159
from game planes I was just playing um

2574
01:46:50.159 --> 01:46:52.469
is motor mania which comes on a cassette

2575
01:46:52.469 --> 01:46:56.760
tape here and that one is a rather nice

2576
01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.609
game for hand-eye coordination I suspect

2577
01:46:59.609 --> 01:47:00.929
it doesn't teach rules of the road

2578
01:47:00.929 --> 01:47:02.999
terribly well but all games have a

2579
01:47:02.999 --> 01:47:04.559
purpose and I'd like to talk about that

2580
01:47:04.559 --> 01:47:05.780
more in a moment

2581
01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:08.339
games of course come on cassette tape as

2582
01:47:08.339 --> 01:47:10.619
I've shown there are games which are on

2583
01:47:10.619 --> 01:47:13.019
disc hears space rescue we'll look at

2584
01:47:13.019 --> 01:47:13.679
that in a moment

2585
01:47:13.679 --> 01:47:15.599
and of course game is the quickest way

2586
01:47:15.599 --> 01:47:17.459
to get a game in the machine is to plug

2587
01:47:17.459 --> 01:47:19.109
it in on a cartridge on the back of the

2588
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:24.239
computer let's take a look at some more

2589
01:47:24.239 --> 01:47:25.919
games they show us the computer very

2590
01:47:25.919 --> 01:47:27.899
very well and it's often the best way to

2591
01:47:27.899 --> 01:47:30.689
assess the computers graphics and sound

2592
01:47:30.689 --> 01:47:33.569
features I'll load space rescue into the

2593
01:47:33.569 --> 01:47:35.959
computer

2594
01:47:43.979 --> 01:47:46.749
so space rescue with sometimes called

2595
01:47:46.749 --> 01:47:48.729
Benji you can see the little dog in here

2596
01:47:48.729 --> 01:47:50.260
which is gonna help you on your voyage

2597
01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.449
of discovery

2598
01:47:52.449 --> 01:47:53.920
the rather interesting thing about this

2599
01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.810
game is it has a high educational

2600
01:47:55.810 --> 01:47:57.820
content those lives a lot of rules

2601
01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:59.260
you'll need the little book to go with

2602
01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:01.030
it if you want to do it let's go and

2603
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:02.560
take a look at the objective of the game

2604
01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:05.409
by indicating an our joystick what we

2605
01:48:05.409 --> 01:48:09.310
want to see space rescue we'll pick a

2606
01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:11.619
rank for Benjy will make that fairly

2607
01:48:11.619 --> 01:48:17.110
long for an easy game a lot of

2608
01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:18.550
instructions here but let's get straight

2609
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:21.639
to the game now we're ready to play and

2610
01:48:21.639 --> 01:48:23.920
the first thing that we know is that

2611
01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.239
we're supposed to look around and look

2612
01:48:25.239 --> 01:48:26.679
for lost scientists and bring them back

2613
01:48:26.679 --> 01:48:28.960
to earth and that's ok but I'd like you

2614
01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.520
to look at the educational content of

2615
01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.230
this game let's take a look here I'm

2616
01:48:32.230 --> 01:48:34.659
going over to take a look at details on

2617
01:48:34.659 --> 01:48:36.760
the various planets for example if I

2618
01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:40.330
call up details on earth here's a great

2619
01:48:40.330 --> 01:48:43.570
deal of quite accurate statistics on the

2620
01:48:43.570 --> 01:48:47.560
planet Earth let's go back and let's

2621
01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:50.949
look for details on for example the

2622
01:48:50.949 --> 01:48:55.300
planet Saturn here's a known information

2623
01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:57.280
on that planet in other words you can

2624
01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.290
play the game you can also learn quite a

2625
01:48:59.290 --> 01:49:02.739
bit about what's going on within these

2626
01:49:02.739 --> 01:49:05.590
actual within the solar system for

2627
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:08.679
example ok will very simply do a little

2628
01:49:08.679 --> 01:49:09.940
bit of traveling around among the

2629
01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:12.250
planets looking for our scientists but

2630
01:49:12.250 --> 01:49:13.600
we certainly won't play this game

2631
01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:16.030
through let's go back and let's say to

2632
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:18.630
the engine room

2633
01:49:19.730 --> 01:49:23.000
okay here's an engine room report and we

2634
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.310
would like to go - why don't we go to

2635
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:32.230
Jupiter and here we go and let's do it

2636
01:49:32.230 --> 01:49:35.410
we go

2637
01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:43.450
[Music]

2638
01:49:43.450 --> 01:49:45.710
at this point we have control of our

2639
01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:47.810
craft

2640
01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:51.609
[Music]

2641
01:49:54.230 --> 01:49:56.480
down we go to the surface looking for a

2642
01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.960
scientist

2643
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:11.250
[Music]

2644
01:50:12.990 --> 01:50:15.040
I'm afraid things are getting very busy

2645
01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.050
on Jupiter and we really don't want to

2646
01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:18.700
show all of the interesting things that

2647
01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:19.890
can happen on this particular

2648
01:50:19.890 --> 01:50:22.270
exploration what I'd like to point out

2649
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:24.370
however is that much of this kind of

2650
01:50:24.370 --> 01:50:26.650
game in many other games are based on a

2651
01:50:26.650 --> 01:50:29.080
good deal of useful information you play

2652
01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.400
the game on whether you know it or not

2653
01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.650
you're learning a great deal more about

2654
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:36.490
the world around you now beyond games is

2655
01:50:36.490 --> 01:50:38.530
a closely related kind of program which

2656
01:50:38.530 --> 01:50:40.900
is called a simulation which actually

2657
01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:43.810
attempts to imitate something perhaps a

2658
01:50:43.810 --> 01:50:46.750
solar system perhaps a micro computer

2659
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:49.180
chip and those can be very useful in

2660
01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:52.180
education and for other things I'd like

2661
01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:54.040
to turn to another program and I'd like

2662
01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:56.440
to show you the cocoa program which

2663
01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:59.160
simulates the inside of a microprocessor

2664
01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:03.190
let's take the cocoa program also by HGS

2665
01:51:03.190 --> 01:51:05.320
and let's put it into our computer I'd

2666
01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:06.810
like to show you some of the parts here

2667
01:51:06.810 --> 01:51:09.820
once again an instruction book we're

2668
01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:11.650
simulating a large fictional computer

2669
01:51:11.650 --> 01:51:13.780
this is an interesting thing this plugs

2670
01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.300
into the joystick part it's part it's

2671
01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:19.180
part of a security connection sometimes

2672
01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:22.750
called a dongle and that will make sure

2673
01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:24.490
that you're an authorized user of this

2674
01:51:24.490 --> 01:51:27.940
package let's plug it in where the

2675
01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:31.990
joystick goes and very soon we'll be

2676
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:35.620
ready to load in the cocoa program here

2677
01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:37.830
we go

2678
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:46.520
Coco is a program which simulates the

2679
01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:49.390
internal workings of a microprocessor

2680
01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:51.830
what we have of the internal registers

2681
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:53.620
that we could never see in an ordinary

2682
01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:55.880
microprocessor now what we see on the

2683
01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:58.460
screen is a group of mythical registers

2684
01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:01.120
real registers in this mythical

2685
01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:04.250
microcomputer down towards the center we

2686
01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:07.610
have our three information registers a X

2687
01:52:07.610 --> 01:52:10.460
and R they're called in this case on

2688
01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:12.740
either side we have memory which is

2689
01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:15.080
called H and L for high and low we have

2690
01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:17.960
five locations in each over to the right

2691
01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:20.000
we have a score which tells us how

2692
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.270
efficient our program is our I Oh which

2693
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:25.340
means our input-output area or what's

2694
01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:28.730
coming in and going out the next command

2695
01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:32.030
that will execute and finally the status

2696
01:52:32.030 --> 01:52:33.980
indicator telling us what we're doing at

2697
01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:36.590
the moment along the top we have the

2698
01:52:36.590 --> 01:52:38.240
commands that we may enter we're going

2699
01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.980
to tell the machine to run in just a

2700
01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:42.680
moment and across the top also we have

2701
01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:45.020
the messages that may turn out if we do

2702
01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:46.940
something wrong along the bottom is our

2703
01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:49.040
program and we'll ask the program to run

2704
01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:51.620
now and see how the internal workings of

2705
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:53.780
the computer can be demonstrated and

2706
01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:56.240
animated on the screen let's take a look

2707
01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:58.940
at these instructions we can see that a

2708
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:00.980
value is being moved into the a register

2709
01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:04.220
that's the first instruction and so on

2710
01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:05.840
the various instructions will be

2711
01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.050
performed as they go now this isn't a

2712
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:10.790
real microcomputer we've seen but some

2713
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:12.440
of the principles can be shown in here

2714
01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:13.880
and some of the internal architecture

2715
01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.670
and so we have a simulation activity

2716
01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:18.320
which is also a challenge to the

2717
01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:20.450
students after they go through example

2718
01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:23.300
programs they might be asked here try

2719
01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:25.130
your hand at making a program that makes

2720
01:53:25.130 --> 01:53:28.460
that we'll do this in the Coco

2721
01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:31.430
microcomputer so we can see a simulation

2722
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:33.230
can do something that we couldn't do in

2723
01:53:33.230 --> 01:53:34.820
real life you can't really look inside a

2724
01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:39.370
microchip and see the registers in there

2725
01:53:40.190 --> 01:53:42.599
now that's probably the thing about

2726
01:53:42.599 --> 01:53:44.639
games it's a challenge and make no

2727
01:53:44.639 --> 01:53:46.260
mistake about it it's a mental challenge

2728
01:53:46.260 --> 01:53:49.230
so what we have going here is a games a

2729
01:53:49.230 --> 01:53:50.520
great motivator you want to write

2730
01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.530
something even in education to make

2731
01:53:52.530 --> 01:53:54.360
people want to play to be challenged

2732
01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.820
think about how the games do it then

2733
01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:58.139
you'll learn a little bit more how to

2734
01:53:58.139 --> 01:54:01.310
use a computer effectively

2735
01:54:02.429 --> 01:54:05.570
now what

2736
01:54:09.369 --> 01:54:11.170
we've had a chance to see some of the

2737
01:54:11.170 --> 01:54:13.239
things you can do with a Commodore 64

2738
01:54:13.239 --> 01:54:15.190
it's only really been a quick

2739
01:54:15.190 --> 01:54:17.139
run-through but perhaps some of the

2740
01:54:17.139 --> 01:54:18.880
potential of the machine is there

2741
01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:21.159
don't let the technical stuff frighten

2742
01:54:21.159 --> 01:54:22.810
you it's only there to make everything

2743
01:54:22.810 --> 01:54:24.880
work don't feel you have to be a

2744
01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:27.090
programmer you don't although sometimes

2745
01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:29.500
programming can be most of the fun

2746
01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:32.020
why else would somebody stay up until 3

2747
01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:33.940
o'clock in the morning cursing and then

2748
01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:35.110
claim the next day that they had a

2749
01:54:35.110 --> 01:54:37.420
wonderful time that's part of what it's

2750
01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:39.460
about I hope that one of the things

2751
01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:41.590
we've communicated with you as a 64 is

2752
01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:43.599
not only a versatile and a useful

2753
01:54:43.599 --> 01:54:46.179
machine good for business good for home

2754
01:54:46.179 --> 01:54:48.580
use but also what's a great deal of fun

2755
01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:50.500
and more than that it's a challenge

2756
01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:53.230
because today that's probably the

2757
01:54:53.230 --> 01:54:55.449
biggest turn-on to know that you can

2758
01:54:55.449 --> 01:54:57.849
test yourself against a computer and

2759
01:54:57.849 --> 01:55:00.900
make things work and make things go I

2760
01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:02.980
don't have enjoyed the little time that

2761
01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:04.050
we spent together

2762
01:55:04.050 --> 01:55:06.670
stay with it you're only really

2763
01:55:06.670 --> 01:55:09.070
beginning to appreciate the things that

2764
01:55:09.070 --> 01:55:13.030
you can do on this machine above all the

2765
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:15.400
computers there to have a good time with

2766
01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:18.420
enjoy it

2767
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:52.439
