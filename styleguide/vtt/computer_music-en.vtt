00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.960
development is pleased to provide major

7
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.320
funding for the computer product the

8
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.449
story of this continuing evolution

9
00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.550
Gary what I have here is a Rob chip in

10
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.230
this cartridge and I'm going to take

11
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.970
this drama trip and take it inside this

12
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.750
machine and load it in there and press a

13
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.750
couple of buttons and if everything

14
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:21.470
works according to plan this is an

15
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.350
example of computer music and computer

16
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.270
music as our subject today this this

17
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.950
little RAM pack which I have over here

18
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.500
has 15 songs on it matter of fact

19
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.420
there's a ROM chip of the Month Club now

20
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.160
where you can buy your popular songs in

21
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.200
a chip instead of on a cassette tape or

22
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.830
on a record this is a simple example but

23
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.929
but how does a computer make music how

24
00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.270
is it doing this well as your were

25
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.800
Stewart this is a very special device

26
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.690
it's not a general-purpose computer but

27
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.159
most of the home computers that are

28
00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.289
available now like the Commodore 64 or

29
00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.390
the IBM personal computer have special

30
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.250
hardware for sound generation or tone

31
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.229
generation and what you do is you write

32
00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.989
a program in basic or logo or one of

33
00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:01.849
those languages if you like and and then

34
00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:03.770
you can produce talent series of tones

35
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.649
and certain frequency and duration and I

36
00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:07.819
get understand there's also there are

37
00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.440
also some software packages coming about

38
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.060
that a like word processing packages

39
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.069
only is for music processing or score

40
00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.959
processing and it's gonna be interesting

41
00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.160
today I think you guys will have some

42
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.390
real experts they'll tell us all about

43
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.610
it indeed we will will be meeting will

44
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.530
Harvey the author of music instruction

45
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.030
set will see a demonstration of the

46
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.610
Alpha Centauri music system and there

47
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.650
are two major centers for computer music

48
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.940
in the country one here in Northern

49
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.470
California at Stanford we'll be meeting

50
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.910
the director of the Stanford center

51
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.980
later on in the program first let's go

52
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.360
across the country to Cambridge

53
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.700
Massachusetts and a visit to mi t--'s

54
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.020
experimental music studio

55
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.670
[Music]

56
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.349
the use of computers and musical

57
00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.870
composing is not a new idea but recent

58
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.640
advances are giving composers a new

59
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.950
degree of power over their medium the

60
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.319
ability to create and manipulate sound

61
00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.550
waves of their own design systems like

62
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.730
MIT s music 100 can detect a note into

63
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.069
its sound wave components the composer

64
00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.230
can then make adjustments to each aspect

65
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.350
of the notes physical characteristics

66
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.160
independently and instantly specially

67
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.319
developed music languages translate the

68
00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.239
sound processing as specified by the

69
00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.120
composer from this input a digital data

70
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.790
stream is computed finally the digital

71
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.799
form is translated into a signal for

72
00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.440
amplification pre-recorded and played

73
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.330
back over audiotape during the

74
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.580
performance a computer that can

75
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.470
reassemble the building blocks of a

76
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.780
sound wave opens up a new spectrum to

77
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.390
the composer and the musician a range of

78
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.549
sounds beyond the natural limits of

79
00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.590
mechanical instruments and the human

80
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.440
voice in a sense the music program can

81
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.630
compose not only the score but the

82
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.329
instrument as well the next step in

83
00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.160
computer composer interaction is

84
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.769
real-time production synthesis a live

85
00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.320
interactive performance between computer

86
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.049
and instrument to achieve this kind of

87
00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.730
instantaneous but programmed

88
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.160
manipulation requires very high-speed

89
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.230
computers capable of several hundred

90
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.970
million calculations per second

91
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.559
[Music]

92
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.920
okay joining us now is will Harvey will

93
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.260
create a music instruction set a hot

94
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.000
piece of software being offered by

95
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.800
Electronic Arts right now and John

96
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.520
Channing John is director of Stanford's

97
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.900
Center for computer research in music

98
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.030
and acoustics right Carmo we call it you

99
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.470
know this invention I think without

100
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.030
Casio telling I finally found an

101
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.310
instrument that I can play John I think

102
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.870
it'd be worthwhile just to talk for a

103
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.990
minute about the the state of the

104
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.280
computer generated music where are we at

105
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.150
today well it's I guess nearly 20 years

106
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.270
old when since Bell Labs engineers and

107
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.140
scientists first conceived the idea and

108
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.330
what's happened in in the recent years

109
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.610
which is evident in things like personal

110
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.930
computers and that is large-scale

111
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.060
integration and what that means

112
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.400
specifically as far as as computer music

113
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.470
is concerned is that we're getting more

114
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.210
and more power in smaller smaller

115
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.980
smaller and smaller units which means

116
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.770
that what was in once in the lab now can

117
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.260
be put in concert hall or in too small

118
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.280
it's smaller environments so some pure

119
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.660
is john and maybe we'll you could talk

120
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.550
from your end on this to think that

121
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.290
computers and music is somehow wrong

122
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.410
it's an Audi personalizing composition

123
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.750
and creativity what what role really

124
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.000
does the computer play in computer music

125
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.790
John well a computer of course being

126
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.450
based upon programming languages is

127
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.360
really an access I think to to a mode of

128
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.070
thought or a body of thought that really

129
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.260
represents I guess tens of thousands of

130
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.970
nine years of thought about thought and

131
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.950
I think that's the significant

132
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.540
difference between computers and music

133
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.240
and electronic musical instruments of

134
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.660
the preceding years that is so as soon

135
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.420
as a computer language is involved there

136
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.440
one has access to a degree of power and

137
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.700
generality which was certainly not the

138
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.010
case in ordinary electronic musical

139
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.540
instruments and look what bills are

140
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.910
wills done here with a personal computer

141
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.890
and a programming language and a

142
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.279
considerable amount of imagination

143
00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.839
it really doesn't deep personalized

144
00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.509
music I think but rather maybe humanism

145
00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.849
humanizes computers I guess I would is

146
00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:38.869
it what do you think it helps with a

147
00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:41.329
composition process to this composing

148
00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:44.329
music does interact I sure I think a

149
00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:46.399
programming language is such an enormous

150
00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:50.149
lis rich resource that it must at any

151
00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:53.289
level enhance the compositional process

152
00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.819
well you guys are different ends a bit

153
00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.709
John is working at Stanford with a big

154
00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.469
mini and a complex operation and you're

155
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:03.979
selling a $40 software from urine how do

156
00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:05.809
you see computers in music meshing I

157
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:07.009
mean how did you get involved in this

158
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.009
combination I think computers are way

159
00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.019
that people can be introduced to music

160
00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:15.110
and with this program what we tried to

161
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.869
do is allow a person who doesn't know

162
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:19.579
anything about music and who might be

163
00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:23.599
intimidated you can buy it to go out and

164
00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:24.919
and to fool around with music already

165
00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.059
already created or to create his own and

166
00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:32.329
I be able to do everything just just

167
00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:34.639
with a joystick maybe you can show us a

168
00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.499
little bit about how a music instruction

169
00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:39.559
so it works okay well basically you're

170
00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.089
moving around with the joystick a little

171
00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:45.279
hand in that hand represents your hand

172
00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:48.559
so in order to create music what you do

173
00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:49.849
is you move your hand around and you

174
00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:51.349
pick up notes and you set them on the

175
00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:54.319
staff what you see there after you get

176
00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:55.819
the notes set up on the staff you can

177
00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:57.259
move to one of these little pictures

178
00:07:57.259 --> 00:08:01.549
here and the pictures do things for

179
00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:02.839
instance if you want to play the music

180
00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:04.249
you go to the little piano which is

181
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:07.789
there or if you want to go to the home

182
00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:09.619
position which is at the beginning of

183
00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:11.719
the song you go to little home and press

184
00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:15.079
the button I've got a piece here that is

185
00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:16.669
included with the product and so I'll

186
00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:18.409
move the hand down to the piano and

187
00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:20.389
press the button it'll play through the

188
00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:21.590
piece

189
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:29.190
[Music]

190
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.800
then going to the home we can go back to

191
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.330
the notes going across the staff who are

192
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.800
showing us the music that the computers

193
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.320
right right

194
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.959
basically it's timed together what it

195
00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:43.630
sounds like and what is on the screen so

196
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.060
it's like having sheet music in front of

197
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.010
you that that Scrolls right past your

198
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.209
desk whereas with the sheet music you

199
00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:53.709
can pick up your pencil and eraser and

200
00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:55.480
erase notes and change them and move

201
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.130
them around or even pull out the

202
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.990
scissors and cut and paste in different

203
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.600
areas with this you can move your hand

204
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.769
around pick up a note move it somewhere

205
00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:08.709
else and drop it if you want to sharpen

206
00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:11.079
note you just press the button to hear

207
00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:13.060
what the note on that particular place

208
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.620
sounds like right actually I dropped the

209
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.690
note and which actually changed the

210
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.040
music that's in there right now so if I

211
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.149
played this it wouldn't sound very

212
00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:22.660
pretty it also tells me what that note

213
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.300
sounds like I'm so if I were composing

214
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.890
music for instance or just wanted to

215
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.610
know where it was I could tune my ear

216
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.380
certainly makes a learning bug music a

217
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.360
lot more fun a lot of times you can

218
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.339
start out instead of having to learn to

219
00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:38.380
play an instrument I'm you have to learn

220
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.670
to use a joystick which is not that

221
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.740
difficult but you can start out by

222
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.680
taking Mozart or Bach and then fooling

223
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.510
around with it and changing notes and

224
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.579
seeing what seeing what it sounds like

225
00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:50.410
what's your experience that people are

226
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.529
first playing around this do they do

227
00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:55.270
they like to learn about music because

228
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.910
of this interaction the first the first

229
00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.550
thing whenever on whenever they see a

230
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.860
new computer program is is to be overly

231
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.690
cautious so they'll move around the hand

232
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.520
and be very careful not to move a note

233
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.890
too far this is that but it doesn't take

234
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.450
too long me five or ten minutes before

235
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.860
they realize hey this is fun I'm not

236
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.329
going to kill myself if I do something

237
00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:13.660
wrong

238
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.520
well you said this program is for people

239
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.230
who don't know too much about music but

240
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.610
you said you've got to take a note and

241
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.140
place it on the staff and a person who

242
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.370
doesn't know much about music doesn't

243
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.779
really know how to do that

244
00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:25.240
well um as far as moving a note around

245
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.430
the instruction manual tells you what

246
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.120
the staff is and some of the basic music

247
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.040
notations you are required to be able to

248
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.510
move around notes move around the hand

249
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.970
pick up and drop notes but you don't

250
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.100
have to know if this is an

251
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.580
B or C sharp or what for instance I can

252
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.670
point to this position here I'm pointing

253
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.620
to that note and I could say well what

254
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.710
am i pointing to right now press P and

255
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.960
it plays the note it says I'm on D and

256
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.180
it also says down here you're sitting on

257
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.020
note D so it correlates the position on

258
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.670
the staff of the note the sound of the

259
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.110
note and the letter name of the note

260
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.680
which is a novel idea John

261
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.840
briefly how would that compare with the

262
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.920
kinds of things you're doing at Stanford

263
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.260
well let's see we assume for example in

264
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.420
our environment that these abstract

265
00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.860
symbols notation have already been

266
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.160
learned I mean our activity is really

267
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.620
centered around musicians who have

268
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.670
studied for some considerable time and

269
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.080
engineers and psycho acquisitions for

270
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.560
example and are interested in notation

271
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.020
is maybe at a slightly different level

272
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.470
having to do rather with music

273
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.840
manuscript and perhaps later we can talk

274
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.700
a bit about that but I think find this

275
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.160
very interesting because it's as Will

276
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.480
has pointed out it's a it's a very

277
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.390
accessible medium and through which one

278
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.040
can learn a rather abstract and

279
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.430
difficult sort of language if you will I

280
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.250
mean music notation I think that's good

281
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.010
okay in just a moment we're going to

282
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.150
take a look at a reasonably

283
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.950
sophisticated device which you can plug

284
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.390
into your computer the Alpha Centauri

285
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.980
system and that's coming up next

286
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.129
[Music]

287
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.280
with us now is Ellen laughing Ellen is

288
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.200
president and co-founder of Centauri

289
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.420
Corporation the people who make the

290
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.580
Alpha Centauri computer music system

291
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.680
Yuri Jelena what you have here seems to

292
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.560
be somewhat different from wills

293
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.410
previous demonstration how does what

294
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.640
you're doing differ from the music

295
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.370
instruction set we're both in the music

296
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.440
business and we're both in fact using

297
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.420
computers to do things that are musical

298
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.210
the key concept behind Centauri and what

299
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.350
we do with music

300
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.390
simply music is turning it into a

301
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.790
musical instrument a live musical

302
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.070
instrument that you can play you can

303
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.410
listen to you can transform sounds with

304
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.900
you can design sound you can compose and

305
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.570
you can even learn keyboard so what I'm

306
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.000
actually can show you today is a program

307
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.520
we call simply music what I'm looking at

308
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.770
on the screen here is a list of albums

309
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.040
just as I have a 45 rpm record on my

310
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.610
player or 33 so I have a disc at it goes

311
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.190
in my disc drive and now when I get to a

312
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.140
directory or catalogue I can see the

313
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.600
list of songs I have previously recorded

314
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.480
or someone else recorded loaded in why

315
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:31.540
don't we listen to yaizu now I played

316
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.490
that piece in a couple of weeks ago or

317
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.200
someone else did or perhaps you played

318
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.210
it in yesterday if you're learning to

319
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.010
play keyboard though listening to music

320
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.750
is not just what you need to do you also

321
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.990
need to see what's going on

322
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.060
[Music]

323
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.649
so we're using the power of the computer

324
00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:52.389
now to give you a keyboard instrument

325
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:55.120
that you can play and listen to give you

326
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.220
a video screen that shows you the music

327
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.819
you're playing and if you don't know how

328
00:14:00.819 --> 00:14:03.069
to read music I will help you even

329
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:05.440
further I can load and display the

330
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.720
keyboard itself so that when I play back

331
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.370
Yazoo I can see the parts that were

332
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.910
played

333
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.040
now that's a fairly complex piece if I

334
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.839
were learning to play music if I'd never

335
00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:21.029
approached a musical instrument before

336
00:14:21.029 --> 00:14:23.759
or a computer music system I might

337
00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:25.980
choose it more easy to learn songs for

338
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.410
instance merrily now this is pretty

339
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.720
simple song but it gets the point across

340
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.239
that you too can learn to play keyboard

341
00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:36.269
with this fairly fancy technology just

342
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:38.509
by

343
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:44.940
[Music]

344
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.070
[Music]

345
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.800
that sounds like segue music Ellen and

346
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.940
I'm going to take advantage of that

347
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.360
music to turn to John for a second and

348
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.829
John one thing of course you're dealing

349
00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:00.360
with a computer so large and couldn't

350
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.649
bring it here in the studio at your

351
00:15:01.649 --> 00:15:03.180
Stanford location one thing you're

352
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.769
involved in is music notation I think

353
00:15:04.769 --> 00:15:05.910
you have an example of that in front of

354
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.709
you sure yeah but that well it's an

355
00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:09.480
extension of the same idea and I guess

356
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.750
so demonstrates what one can do with an

357
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.490
enormous amount of effort and over in a

358
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.709
large number of years this is a program

359
00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:18.300
that was developed by Lehman Smith also

360
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.569
on the music faculty who over a 10-year

361
00:15:21.569 --> 00:15:24.660
period has has refined the music

362
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.819
manuscript

363
00:15:25.819 --> 00:15:27.839
program which allows one to use a

364
00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.459
standard printer plotter

365
00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:32.040
to output music and large scale and it's

366
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.019
photo reduced for to become publisher

367
00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:36.990
quality well the advantages are that his

368
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.569
program automatically finds does part

369
00:15:39.569 --> 00:15:42.269
extraction finds page turns and and of

370
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:44.250
course eliminates all the problems of

371
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.680
error making and music publishing so

372
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.360
it's a it's a contribution of

373
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.940
considerable importance I think in the

374
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.339
music industry the same basic ideas but

375
00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:54.959
reaching a very high degree of

376
00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:55.680
refinement

377
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.389
John okay you've brought with with you

378
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:59.069
an audio tape from your system at

379
00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:00.329
Stanford we're going to play that tape

380
00:16:00.329 --> 00:16:01.290
right now and if you can put on the

381
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.819
headset so that you can hear it as we

382
00:16:02.819 --> 00:16:04.769
play it and and tell us what's going on

383
00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:08.370
in this audio tape okay this is an

384
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.000
example of high quality vocal synthesis

385
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.269
using frequency modulation synthesis it

386
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:18.149
took it took me about six months to find

387
00:16:18.149 --> 00:16:20.760
the little cused and naturalness that

388
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.670
seemed to be so very often lacking and

389
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.910
in most electronic music synthesis now

390
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.920
having worked out this algorithm we can

391
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.170
play the next example and hear an

392
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.170
extension of nature into a slightly

393
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.110
unreal domain for example I modeled now

394
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.630
the human voice but of a very very large

395
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.630
man so it's deeper than any real human

396
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.089
being could sing as if he had a six-foot

397
00:16:45.089 --> 00:16:47.250
chest chest I guess in the 3-foot neck

398
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.680
so the vertical resonance is amazing

399
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.569
amplified because we have this

400
00:16:51.569 --> 00:16:53.339
independent control over the dimensions

401
00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:54.630
of sound in

402
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:58.230
Stratfor now one of the most important

403
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.230
things about synthesis and which will

404
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.770
accrue to devices as such as this and

405
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.510
the things that little synthesis

406
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.059
algorithm that will which using has to

407
00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:11.130
do with using the technology in such a

408
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.579
way that we we we have a very clear

409
00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.319
sense of what's natural sounding the

410
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.140
next example demonstrates first just a

411
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.910
pure tone which will mill here which is

412
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.949
the pitch of what will become a some

413
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:28.980
vocal tone then in a few seconds we had

414
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.289
all the harmonics or information that

415
00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:35.820
would be president in real some tone but

416
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.530
it only becomes natural at the moment we

417
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.320
introduce the vibrato and this kind of

418
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.140
wiggling in the pitch space which is

419
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.289
common to all natural sounds virtually

420
00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:49.920
much more pure tone

421
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.710
now harmonics but not natural

422
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.809
and now it sounds natural sounds vocal

423
00:17:57.809 --> 00:18:03.539
like so we can by doing a vast amount of

424
00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:05.429
research and analysis in cyclic ooh

425
00:18:05.429 --> 00:18:07.679
snakes and signal processing we can

426
00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:10.350
extend to this miniaturization which we

427
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.110
see a kind of quality of sound which I

428
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.610
think will be a very great improvement

429
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.559
okay John we're going to move from

430
00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.509
Stanford now and go back across the

431
00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:20.970
country to Cambridge and MIT is

432
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.220

433
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.440

438
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.590
John is a work that we're seeing in

439
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.510
computer generated music is that still

440
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.520
mostly in the laboratory or is it being

441
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.100
used in production well I think with the

442
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.200
large scale integration we're seeing

443
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.820
many of the techniques that have been

444
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.550
developed and programs etc over the

445
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.340
years that in the context of a lab

446
00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.680
finding application now in industry I

447
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.680
there are you know music synthesis

448
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.630
algorithms that can be implemented in

449
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.300
large-scale integrated circuits we'll

450
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.850
certainly more and more find find use

451
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.460
and devices of this sort and organs and

452
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.000
synthesizers and who knows what else

453
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.980
Ellen you mentioned earlier the concept

454
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.110
of your floppy disk is a kind of record

455
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.730
album with titles on it we saw at the

456
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.230
beginning of the program is kind of Rama

457
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.940
cartridge do you see a kind of new form

458
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.650
of music publishing and what you would

459
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.690
buy floppy disks for a computer playback

460
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.650
system absolutely in fact my floppy disk

461
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.740
is my personal diskette I can self

462
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.750
publish which means that now I'm a

463
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.970
composer and a publisher all rolled up

464
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.060
into one that is I have my Satori I save

465
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.550
I generate my own music I save it on

466
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.830
diskette and I can send it off to

467
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.540
friends across the country or around the

468
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.790
world so now I read every musician and

469
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.950
every student becomes a publisher and

470
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.990
that means also that the teachers become

471
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.360
publishers of their own musical material

472
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.270
and the professional composers can also

473
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.910
publish for the audience of people who

474
00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.670
have the same instrument so absolutely

475
00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.800
yes it is a new form of publishing but a

476
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.930
very personal one very quickly we have

477
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.000
about a half a minute left do you find a

478
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.800
resistance among professional musicians

479
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.549
and composers

480
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:08.309
they really love to get into this well

481
00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:11.489
Stanford virtually every composer who

482
00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:14.940
comes to study there not only learns

483
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.919
about computer music becomes a rather

484
00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:19.769
exceptionally good programmer so I think

485
00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:21.119
there's very little resistance

486
00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:22.440
especially in the young generation after

487
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.019
all people to start the age of is at

488
00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:27.840
will of the young men well I mean he's

489
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.249
already beat the hurdle you see he

490
00:21:29.249 --> 00:21:30.809
already understands a great deal about

491
00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:32.369
programming because these things are in

492
00:21:32.369 --> 00:21:33.659
the environment and that's good

493
00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.730
okay John shouting of Stanford and Ellen

494
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.350
laughs moves and Tory thanks so much for
